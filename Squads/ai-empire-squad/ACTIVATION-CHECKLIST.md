## 🤔 Common Questions

### Q: Do I really have 10 agents working for me?
**A:** Yes! All AI-powered, working 24/7, in parallel. You sleep, they iterate.

### Q: What if I don't know what to build?
**A:** That's exactly why you have the Business Strategist + AI Strategist + Product Manager. The Opportunity Discovery task finds 5 ideas for you.

### Q: Can I skip some agents?
**A:** Sure! You can start with Tier 1 + 2 (decision-makers), then add Tier 3 (builders). But having all 10 is what makes this work.

### Q: What if the squad disagrees?
**A:** Master Coordinator synthesizes. You have final say. Mentor helps you decide based on founder wisdom.

### Q: How much does this cost?
**A:** Just Claude API credits. You control the usage.

### Q: Can I use this for something other than business?
**A:** Yes! The architecture works for any large project. Adjust the focus from "million-dollar business" to your goal.

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Task-First Architecture
Everything is organized as executable tasks that get done in sequence or parallel. No ambiguity.

### Tier System
- **Tier 1:** Coordination
- **Tier 2:** Strategic thinking
- **Tier 3:** Execution/building
- **Tier 4:** Governance/oversight

### Roundtable Model
3 strategists debate and decide what to build. Removes single-point-of-view bias.

### Parallel Execution
Tier 3 builders work simultaneously on architecture, code, data, infrastructure.

### Data-Driven Everything
Every decision backed by metrics. Pivot or persevere based on real data.
