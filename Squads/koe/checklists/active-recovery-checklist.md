## 1. Physical Activity Setup

```yaml
physical_activity:
  movement_type:
    - [ ] Activity is non-cognitively demanding (walking, lifting, swimming)
    - [ ] Activity allows mind to wander freely
    - [ ] No screens or explicit media consumption during activity
    - [ ] Duration sufficient for diffuse thinking (minimum 20 minutes)
  environment:
    - [ ] Environment change from work space (different room, outdoors)
    - [ ] Low-stimulation environment preferred
    - [ ] Capture tool accessible without breaking flow (voice memo, pocket notebook)
```

---

## 2. Insight Capture Protocol

```yaml
insight_capture:
  readiness:
    - [ ] Capture method chosen BEFORE starting activity
    - [ ] Voice memo or quick-note tool tested and ready
    - [ ] No friction between insight and capture (under 10 seconds)
  capture_quality:
    - [ ] Insights captured as raw audio or quick text (no editing)
    - [ ] Context of physical activity noted (walk, gym, shower)
    - [ ] Emotional intensity of insight logged
    - [ ] Time of day recorded for pattern recognition
    - [ ] Insight tagged as "recovery" for queue processing
```

---

## 3. Flow State Recognition

```yaml
flow_states:
  awareness:
    - [ ] Recognize when Default Mode Network activates (mind wandering productively)
    - [ ] Do NOT force insights — let them emerge naturally
    - [ ] Notice pattern: which activities produce the most insights
    - [ ] Track time-to-first-insight per activity type
  protection:
    - [ ] No interruptions during active recovery (phone on DND)
    - [ ] No task-switching during recovery block
    - [ ] Recovery block treated as sacred as deep work block
    - [ ] Others informed this is not "free time"
```

---

## 4. Recovery-to-Queue Pipeline

```yaml
recovery_pipeline:
  processing:
    - [ ] All recovery captures reviewed within 24 hours
    - [ ] Voice memos transcribed and added to queue
    - [ ] Recovery insights cross-referenced with current projects
    - [ ] High-signal insights fast-tracked to synthesis
  quality_filter:
    - [ ] Insights that survive 24h review are genuine (not just endorphin-driven)
    - [ ] Recovery insights marked with confidence level
    - [ ] Duplicate or trivial insights purged
```

---

## 5. Recovery Scheduling

```yaml
scheduling:
  frequency:
    - [ ] Minimum 1 active recovery block per day
    - [ ] Recovery blocks scheduled (not left to chance)
    - [ ] Recovery follows intensive cognitive work (Empty/Use phases)
    - [ ] Weekend recovery sessions longer (45-60 min)
  optimization:
    - [ ] Activity type rotated to avoid habituation
    - [ ] Most productive activity identified and prioritized
    - [ ] Recovery data reviewed weekly (insights per session)
    - [ ] Adjustment made if recovery sessions produce zero captures for 3+ days
```

## Scoring

| Category | Items | Points Each | Max |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----|
| Critical — Capture Protocol & Flow Protection | 10 | 3 | 30 |
| Standard — Physical Setup & Pipeline | 12 | 2 | 24 |
| Bonus — Scheduling & Optimization | 8 | 1 | 8 |
| **TOTAL** | **30** | | **62** |

### Thresholds
- **PASS**: >= 50 points (80%)
- **CONDITIONAL**: >= 37 points (60%)
- **FAIL**: < 37 points

### If FAIL
1. Start with ONE activity (walking) and ONE capture method (voice memo)
2. Schedule 3 recovery blocks this week — treat them as non-negotiable meetings
3. Review captures after 3 days — if zero insights, increase activity duration to 30+ minutes
4. Track which activity type produces the most insights and double down
