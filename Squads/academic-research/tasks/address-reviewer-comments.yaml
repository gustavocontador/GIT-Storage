how_to_respond:
  agree_and_revise:
    response: "We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. We have revised..."
    action: "Make the change, cite location"

  partially_agree:
    response: "We appreciate this suggestion. However, we believe that..."
    action: "Explain why you can't fully comply, offer compromise"

  disagree_respectfully:
    response: "We respectfully disagree with this comment because..."
    action: "Provide evidence/reasoning, don't be defensive"

  clarify:
    response: "We thank the reviewer for pointing out this lack of clarity. We have clarified..."
    action: "Add clarification to manuscript"

tone_guidelines:
  - Be respectful and professional (never defensive or hostile)
  - Thank reviewers for their time and feedback
  - Acknowledge when they're right
  - Explain clearly when you disagree
  - Show you took comments seriously
  - Use phrases like "We appreciate..." "We thank..." "We agree..."

best_practices:
  - Address EVERY comment (even minor ones)
  - Quote exact reviewer comment before responding
  - Cite exact location of changes in manuscript
  - Use track changes to show edits
  - Be specific about what you changed
  - If you can't comply, explain why clearly
  - Proofread response letter carefully

common_pitfalls:
  - Being defensive or hostile
  - Ignoring "minor" comments
  - Not citing location of changes
  - Vague responses ("we revised the manuscript")
  - Arguing without evidence
  - Not thanking reviewers

example_responses:
  good:
    comment: "The sample size is too small for generalization."
    response: "We thank the reviewer for this important comment. We have added a limitation section (page 12, lines 234-238) acknowledging that our sample size (N=50) limits generalizability. We have also revised our conclusion to be more cautious about claiming broad applicability."

  bad:
    comment: "The sample size is too small for generalization."
    response: "We disagree. Our sample size is adequate."
    # Why bad: defensive, no evidence, no compromise
