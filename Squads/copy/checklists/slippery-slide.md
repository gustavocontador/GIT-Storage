# Slippery Slide Checklist (Joe Sugarman)

**Checklist ID:** slippery-slide
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Purpose:** Verify copy maintains the "slippery slide" — every element leads to reading the next

---

## The Test

Read each element of the copy in order. For each transition, ask: "Am I compelled to keep reading?"

### Headline → First Sentence
- [ ] The headline creates enough curiosity to read the first sentence
- [ ] The first sentence is SHORT (under 10 words ideally)
- [ ] The first sentence does NOT try to sell — only to get you to read sentence two

### First Paragraph
- [ ] Each sentence flows naturally to the next
- [ ] No jargon or complex ideas in the opening
- [ ] The reader is being "greased" into the copy

### Body Copy Flow
- [ ] Subheads create curiosity (not just label sections)
- [ ] Each paragraph ends with a hook or seed of curiosity
- [ ] Examples of seeds: "But there's more...", "Here's where it gets interesting...", "And that's not even the best part..."
- [ ] No paragraph is longer than 5 lines
- [ ] Transitions between sections feel natural, not jarring

### Psychological Triggers Present
Check at least 5 of these:
- [ ] Authority (expert endorsement, credentials)
- [ ] Social Proof (testimonials, numbers)
- [ ] Scarcity (limited supply or time)
- [ ] Urgency (reason to act NOW)
- [ ] Reciprocity (free value given first)
- [ ] Honesty (admitting a flaw or limitation)
- [ ] Specificity (exact numbers, not round)
- [ ] Curiosity (open loops that need closing)
- [ ] Storytelling (narrative that pulls reader forward)
- [ ] Exclusivity (not available to everyone)

### Buying Environment
- [ ] Layout is clean and inviting (not cluttered)
- [ ] Typography supports readability
- [ ] Opening paragraphs create the right emotional atmosphere
- [ ] The copy FEELS like a conversation, not a presentation

### Close
- [ ] The CTA follows naturally from the copy flow
- [ ] There's no abrupt shift from content to selling
- [ ] The offer feels like the logical next step
- [ ] Seeds of curiosity are resolved by the offer
