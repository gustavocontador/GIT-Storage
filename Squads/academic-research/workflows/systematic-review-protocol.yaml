  - Dual data extraction
  - Quality assessment of included studies
  - PRISMA flow diagram
  - PRISMA 2020 27-item checklist completed
  - Transparent reporting of all steps

success_criteria:
  - Protocol registered on PROSPERO
  - Comprehensive search documented
  - All screening decisions documented with reasons
  - Quality assessment completed for all studies
  - Synthesis (narrative or meta-analysis) conducted
  - PRISMA guidelines followed
  - Manuscript published

deliverables:
  - Registered protocol (PROSPERO)
  - Search strategy document with all strings
  - PRISMA flow diagram
  - Data extraction table
  - Quality assessment results
  - Complete systematic review manuscript
  - PRISMA 2020 checklist (completed)
  - Supplementary materials

best_practices:
  - Register protocol BEFORE starting search
  - Use at least 3 major databases
  - Conduct dual screening and extraction
  - Document all decisions transparently
  - Use validated quality assessment tools
  - Follow PRISMA 2020 guidelines strictly
  - Include grey literature when appropriate

common_pitfalls:
  - Not registering protocol (appears like p-hacking)
  - Search too narrow (miss relevant studies)
  - Single reviewer screening (bias risk)
  - Poor documentation of search strategy
  - Not assessing study quality
  - Cherry-picking studies to include
  - Incomplete PRISMA reporting

quality_assessment_tools:
  quantitative_studies:
    - Cochrane Risk of Bias tool
    - Newcastle-Ottawa Scale
    - Jadad Scale

  qualitative_studies:
    - CASP Qualitative Checklist
    - COREQ checklist

  systematic_reviews:
    - AMSTAR 2
