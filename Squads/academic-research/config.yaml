best_practices:
  research_design:
    - Start with clear research questions (SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
    - Pre-register study protocol when possible (PROSPERO for systematic reviews, OSF for other studies)
    - Get ethics approval BEFORE data collection
    - Plan for adequate sample size (power analysis for quantitative)

  literature_review:
    - Use broad search initially, then screen (better than narrow search)
    - Conduct dual screening for systematic reviews (two independent reviewers)
    - Document all search strings and decisions
    - Include grey literature when appropriate (theses, reports, preprints)

  writing:
    - Follow IMRaD structure strictly
    - Use past tense for methods and results
    - Use present tense for general facts
    - One idea per paragraph with clear topic sentences
    - Cite as you write (don't wait until the end)

  citations:
    - Use reference manager (never format manually)
    - Always include DOI when available
    - Be consistent with citation style
    - Check for plagiarism before submission

  peer_review:
    - Get internal peer review before submission
    - Address ALL reviewer comments (even minor ones)
    - Be respectful and professional in responses
    - Never be defensive or hostile

common_pitfalls:
  research_design:
    - Unclear or vague research questions
    - Methodology too ambitious for timeline/resources
    - Ignoring ethical considerations until too late
    - Not considering potential limitations upfront

  literature_review:
    - Search too narrow (miss relevant papers)
    - Cherry-picking studies that support hypothesis
    - No quality assessment of included studies
    - Ignoring contradictory findings

  writing:
    - Overclaiming ("proves" instead of "suggests")
    - Missing methodological details (can't replicate)
    - Results interpretation in results section (keep objective)
    - Poor writing quality burying good research

  citations:
    - Inconsistent formatting (mixing styles)
    - Missing information (incomplete citations)
    - Plagiarism (not paraphrasing, no citations)
    - Self-plagiarism (not citing own prior work)

  submission:
    - Submitting before manuscript is truly ready
    - Not following journal formatting guidelines
    - Weak or generic cover letter
    - Defensive responses to reviewers
