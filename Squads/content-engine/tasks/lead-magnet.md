# Lead Magnet

```yaml
id: lead-magnet
execution_type: Agent
purpose: Design a high-value lead magnet that demonstrates the Next Step methodology, using the Value Equation to maximize perceived value and drive session bookings.
executor: @alex-hormozi
inputs:
  - Next Step service details (sessao de clareza e direcao, what it covers)
  - Target audience profile and pain points
  - Brand thesis ("Obesidade mental trava. Clareza liberta.")
  - Current conversion path (how people currently book)
preconditions:
  - Content philosophy defined (topic pillars)
  - Understanding of what happens in a Next Step session
  - Clear differentiation from competitors
steps:
  1. Identify the Dream Outcome for the audience:
     - What does "clarity" look and feel like specifically?
     - What decisions would they make if they had it?
     - What would their life look like in 90 days with clarity?
  2. Apply the Value Equation to the lead magnet:
     - Increase Dream Outcome: Promise a specific, tangible result
     - Increase Perceived Likelihood: Show proof it works (testimonials, method)
     - Decrease Time Delay: Deliver value immediately (not "in 6 weeks")
     - Decrease Effort/Sacrifice: Make it easy to consume (< 15 min)
  3. Design the lead magnet format (choose best fit):
     - Option A: "Diagnostico de Clareza" — Self-assessment quiz (5 questions)
     - Option B: "Mapa Rapido" — 1-page clarity framework (PDF)
     - Option C: "3 Perguntas" — Short video walking through 3 diagnostic questions
     - Option D: "Checklist de Obesidade Mental" — Symptom checklist with scoring
  4. Build the value stack:
     - Core: The lead magnet itself
     - Bonus 1: Quick-win action step (do this today)
     - Bonus 2: Example of a real transformation (anonymized case)
     - Stack total perceived value vs. actual cost (free)
  5. Design the conversion bridge:
     - Lead magnet → reveals the problem clearly
     - Problem awareness → "you need a guide for this"
     - Guide → Next Step as the natural next step
     - CTA: Clear, low-friction booking path
  6. Write the landing page copy outline:
     - Headline (Grand Slam Offer style)
     - 3 bullet points (what they get)
     - Social proof element
     - CTA button text
  7. Define distribution strategy:
     - Bio link on all platforms
     - CTA in content pieces (when and how)
     - Direct message sequence for warm leads
outputs:
  - Lead magnet concept document with:
    - Format choice and rationale
    - Value Equation breakdown
    - Value stack description
    - Conversion bridge flow
    - Landing page copy outline
    - Distribution strategy
validation:
  - Value Equation clearly scored (dream outcome, likelihood, time, effort)
  - Lead magnet delivers genuine value (not just a teaser)
  - Clear logical bridge from lead magnet to Next Step booking
  - Landing page copy sounds like Tiago (direto, pratico, no fluff)
  - Distribution strategy covers at least 3 channels
  - Lead magnet can be consumed in under 15 minutes
