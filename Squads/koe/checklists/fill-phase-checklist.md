## 1. Source Quality

```yaml
source_quality:
  curation_standards:
    - [ ] Sources curated intentionally (not algorithm-fed)
    - [ ] Source list reviewed and pruned monthly
    - [ ] Each source passes the "Would I pay for this?" test
    - [ ] No more than 30% of sources from a single domain
  authority_check:
    - [ ] Sources are practitioners (not just commentators)
    - [ ] Track record of original thinking verified
    - [ ] Sources challenge your existing mental models
    - [ ] At least 2 sources from outside your primary domain
```

---

## 2. 80/20 Consumption Ratio

```yaml
consumption_ratio:
  depth_vs_breadth:
    - [ ] 80% of consumption time on high-signal sources
    - [ ] 20% reserved for exploration and serendipity
    - [ ] High-signal sources produce actionable insights per session
    - [ ] Exploration time produces at least 1 novel connection per week
  anti_patterns:
    - [ ] No passive scrolling counted as "consumption"
    - [ ] No consumption without capture intent
    - [ ] Time-boxed sessions (max 60 min per Fill block)
    - [ ] Consumption halted when queue is overflowing
```

---

## 3. Cross-Domain Coverage

```yaml
cross_domain:
  minimum_domains:
    - [ ] Consuming from minimum 3 distinct domains
    - [ ] Domains span: business + philosophy/psychology + science/technology
    - [ ] At least 1 domain is outside comfort zone
    - [ ] Domain balance reviewed monthly
  renaissance_alignment:
    - [ ] Consumption supports Digital Renaissance identity (not specialist trap)
    - [ ] Cross-domain connections noted during consumption
    - [ ] Unexpected parallels flagged for synthesis
```

---

## 4. Active Consumption Protocol

```yaml
active_consumption:
  engagement:
    - [ ] Reading/watching with question in mind (not passive)
    - [ ] Key insights captured in real-time to queue
    - [ ] Disagreements and tensions noted (not just agreements)
    - [ ] Mental models being challenged, not just confirmed
  output_per_session:
    - [ ] Minimum 3 queue items per Fill session
    - [ ] At least 1 item tagged as "synthesis potential"
    - [ ] Session ends with 1-sentence summary of biggest insight
```

---

## 5. Cycle Timing

```yaml
cycle_timing:
  fill_schedule:
    - [ ] Fill sessions scheduled (not random)
    - [ ] Fill happens BEFORE creative work (not after)
    - [ ] Fill session duration matches energy level
    - [ ] No Fill sessions when queue needs processing first
  balance:
    - [ ] Fill time does not exceed Empty + Use time combined
    - [ ] Consumption tracked (hours per week)
    - [ ] Consumption-to-output ratio improving over time
```

## Scoring

| Category | Items | Points Each | Max |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----|
| Critical — Source Quality & 80/20 Ratio | 10 | 3 | 30 |
| Standard — Cross-Domain & Active Protocol | 13 | 2 | 26 |
| Bonus — Cycle Timing & Balance | 7 | 1 | 7 |
| **TOTAL** | **30** | | **63** |

### Thresholds
- **PASS**: >= 50 points (80%)
- **CONDITIONAL**: >= 38 points (60%)
- **FAIL**: < 38 points

### If FAIL
1. Audit your source list — remove any source that hasn't produced an insight in 30 days
2. Add 2 cross-domain sources immediately (one from philosophy, one from science)
3. Set a timer for your next 3 Fill sessions and capture queue items in real-time
4. Measure: if zero queue items after a Fill session, the source or method is wrong
