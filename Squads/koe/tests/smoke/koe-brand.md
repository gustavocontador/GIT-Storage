# Smoke Tests: koe-brand

## Test 1: Personal Monopoly Audit
**Scenario:** User describes their current brand positioning using traditional niching. Agent must diagnose the commodity trap and redirect to Personal Monopoly.
**Input:** "I'm a social media marketing consultant for small businesses. I help them grow on Instagram. There are thousands of people doing the same thing. How do I stand out?"
**Expected Behavior:**
- Diagnoses commodity positioning: "social media marketing for small businesses" has thousands of competitors because it is traditional niching, not a Personal Monopoly
- Applies "You Are The Niche" framework: guides user to discover their unique intersection of interests + skills + experience
- Asks discovery questions about what makes THEM unique beyond the service:
  - What other domains are you genuinely curious about? (philosophy? psychology? fitness?)
  - What personal transformation led you to this work?
  - What do you believe that most social media marketers don't?
- Builds toward a Personal Monopoly positioning: "I teach [specific audience] to [outcome] using [your unique methodology from your intersection]"
- References "Specialization is for insects" and "No one can compete with you being you"
- Distinguishes between traditional moat (features, price, speed -- all copyable) and Personal Monopoly moat (YOU -- uncopyable)
**Pass Criteria:** Diagnoses commodity positioning, applies You Are The Niche framework, asks intersection discovery questions, builds toward Personal Monopoly statement, distinguishes traditional vs monopoly moat.
**Fail Signals:** Suggests "niching down further" (e.g., "Instagram for dentists"); recommends competing on price or features; focuses on follower growth as differentiation; uses "find your niche" language instead of "you are the niche."

## Test 2: Authority Construction Without Credentials
**Scenario:** User feels unqualified to build a personal brand because they lack formal credentials.
**Input:** "I don't have a degree in marketing. I never worked at a big agency. Why would anyone listen to me? Shouldn't I get certified first?"
**Expected Behavior:**
- Rejects credential-based authority immediately and directly
- Applies the Authoritative Brand Construction framework: authority comes from documented frameworks + consistent Big Ideas + proof (your results) + community adoption
- References Dan Koe's own story: no business degree, built $3.3M/year, authority from DOING IT not credentials
- Provides specific action steps:
  - Document your frameworks (how YOU think about problems)
  - Share your Big Ideas (challenge conventional wisdom in your space)
  - Prove with results (screenshots, testimonials, case studies of your outcomes)
  - Build community (people who adopt your worldview)
- Uses "Proof over promise" heuristic: "I did this, here's how" beats "I studied this"
- Triggers the immune system against credential worship
**Pass Criteria:** Rejects credentials as authority source, provides Authoritative Brand Construction framework, references Koe's credential-free authority, gives specific non-credential authority-building steps.
**Fail Signals:** Recommends getting certified; validates the belief that credentials are necessary; suggests "building credibility through associations"; does not challenge the credential paradigm.

## Test 3: Niche Uniqueness via Anti-Vision and Leverage Stack Order
**Scenario:** User wants to start building their brand but is focused on automation and scaling before establishing trust.
**Input:** "I want to automate my content and build a funnel before I even start posting. I'll use AI to generate posts, set up email sequences, and build a course. Then I'll launch everything at once."
**Expected Behavior:**
- Diagnoses Leverage Stack violation: user is starting at Layer 4 (Automation) before building Layer 1 (Brand/Trust)
- Enforces the build order: Brand (trust asset) FIRST, then Digital Products, then Content Systems, then Automation
- Explains why order matters: "Can't automate what doesn't exist yet. Automation amplifies signal, but you need signal first."
- Warns against AI-generated content as brand substitute: brand IS your voice, your thinking, your frameworks -- outsourcing that is outsourcing your monopoly
- Recommends starting with Anti-Vision clarity: what does the brand reject? This is as important as what it embraces
- References "Content IS the brand" -- the ideas you share and how you share them = your brand
- Provides Phase 1 action plan: define intersection, write 5 posts sharing your thinking, build trust BEFORE systems
**Pass Criteria:** Identifies Leverage Stack order violation, enforces Brand-first sequence, warns against AI-replacing personal voice, recommends Anti-Vision clarity, provides sequential action plan.
**Fail Signals:** Approves the automation-first approach; suggests "it's fine to start with systems"; does not enforce Leverage Stack order; ignores the brand-as-trust-asset foundation; supports AI-generated personal brand content.
