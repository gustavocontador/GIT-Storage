## 1. Core Offer Irresistibility

```yaml
core_irresistibility:
  clarity:
    - [ ] Offer can be understood in one sentence
    - [ ] What the buyer gets is crystal clear (no ambiguity)
    - [ ] Outcome is stated in buyer's language (not creator jargon)
  desire_match:
    - [ ] Offer solves a burning problem the audience talks about daily
    - [ ] Offer addresses the gap between where they are and where they want to be
    - [ ] Offer feels like "this was made for me" to the target buyer
  differentiation:
    - [ ] Offer is not available anywhere else in this exact form
    - [ ] Unique mechanism or approach identified and named
    - [ ] Competitive alternatives acknowledged and surpassed
    - [ ] "Why this and not that" objection pre-handled
```

## 2. Bonus Architecture (Exceeds Core Value)

```yaml
bonus_architecture:
  quantity:
    - [ ] Minimum 3 bonuses included
    - [ ] Each bonus has individual price anchor
    - [ ] Total bonus value exceeds core offer price
  relevance:
    - [ ] Every bonus solves a problem created by or adjacent to the core offer
    - [ ] No filler bonuses (each must pass "would I buy this standalone?" test)
    - [ ] At least one bonus is a shortcut/accelerator (saves time)
    - [ ] At least one bonus is a tool/template (saves effort)
  presentation:
    - [ ] Bonuses revealed one-by-one (not in a lump)
    - [ ] Each bonus has its own mini-pitch (problem → solution → value)
    - [ ] Bonuses are visually represented (mockups, screenshots)
    - [ ] "Fast action" bonus with genuine deadline
```

## 3. Perceived Value 10x Price

```yaml
perceived_value:
  anchoring:
    - [ ] Total value anchored at 10x+ the asking price
    - [ ] Each component priced individually before reveal
    - [ ] "What you'd normally pay" comparison established
    - [ ] Price positioned as fraction of the outcome value
  value_demonstration:
    - [ ] ROI calculation shown (investment → expected return)
    - [ ] Cost of inaction calculated (what staying stuck costs per month/year)
    - [ ] Comparison to alternatives (coaching, courses, degrees, agencies)
  believability:
    - [ ] Value claims are supported by evidence, not just assertion
    - [ ] Social proof placed next to value claims
    - [ ] Creator's own results cited as proof of system
```

---

## 4. Real Scarcity

```yaml
real_scarcity:
  legitimacy:
    - [ ] Scarcity reason is genuine and explained
    - [ ] Limit is operationally real (capacity, cohort, time-based)
    - [ ] No fake countdown timers or manufactured urgency
  types:
    - [ ] At least one scarcity mechanism active:
      - Cohort-based (limited seats, next cohort in X weeks)
      - Price-based (price increases after X sales or date)
      - Bonus-based (fast-action bonus disappears after deadline)
      - Access-based (doors close, waitlist activates)
    - [ ] Scarcity communicated without desperation
    - [ ] What happens after scarcity trigger is clear (waitlist, higher price, etc.)
  ethics:
    - [ ] Scarcity is consistent (don't say "last chance" then reopen tomorrow)
    - [ ] Honoring scarcity builds long-term trust
    - [ ] No pressure tactics that make buyer feel manipulated
```

---

## 5. Offer Presentation Flow

```yaml
presentation_flow:
  structure:
    - [ ] Problem agitation → Solution reveal → Core offer → Bonuses → Price → CTA
    - [ ] Each section builds on the previous (momentum, not repetition)
    - [ ] Objections handled inline, not in separate FAQ only
  emotional_journey:
    - [ ] Buyer feels understood at the start (problem resonance)
    - [ ] Buyer feels hopeful in the middle (solution clarity)
    - [ ] Buyer feels excited at the end (value overwhelming)
    - [ ] Buyer feels safe at CTA (risk reversal + social proof)
  koe_authenticity:
    - [ ] No hype language that contradicts Dan Koe's tone
    - [ ] Education-first approach (teach before sell)
    - [ ] Offer feels like natural next step, not hard pitch
```

## Scoring

| Category | Items | Points Each | Max |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----|
| Critical — Core Offer Irresistibility | 10 | 3 | 30 |
| Critical — Perceived Value 10x Price | 9 | 3 | 27 |
| Standard — Bonus Architecture | 11 | 2 | 22 |
| Standard — Real Scarcity | 9 | 2 | 18 |
| Bonus — Offer Presentation Flow | 10 | 1 | 10 |
| **TOTAL** | **49** | | **107** |

### Thresholds
- **PASS**: >= 86 points (80%)
- **CONDITIONAL**: >= 65 points (60%)
- **FAIL**: < 65 points

### If FAIL
1. Rewrite core offer to be understandable in one sentence — if you can't, simplify
2. Rebuild bonus stack — each bonus must pass the "would buy standalone" test
3. Re-anchor value at minimum 10x price with specific ROI calculation
4. Audit scarcity for authenticity — remove anything fake, add genuine limits
5. Test offer copy on 3 people from target audience — if they don't say "how do I buy?", iterate
