success_criteria:
  - Clear research questions defined
  - Methodology is sound and replicable
  - Timeline is realistic with buffer
  - Ethics considerations addressed
  - Target journal/conference identified

deliverables:
  - Research design document (5-10 pages)
  - Methodology section draft
  - Timeline with milestones
  - Ethics application draft (if needed)

best_practices:
  - Start with broad literature review to identify gaps
  - Ensure research questions are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
  - Consider feasibility (time, resources, access to participants)
  - Pre-register study protocol when possible (PROSPERO for systematic reviews)
  - Get IRB/ethics approval BEFORE data collection

common_pitfalls:
  - Vague research questions that can't be answered
  - Methodology too ambitious for timeline/resources
  - Ignoring ethical considerations until too late
  - Not considering potential limitations upfront
