## Execution Model: Hybrid (Playwright + SSH)

```
PHASE A: Playwright (browser)     USER logs in -> AGENT automates UI
PHASE B-E: SSH (terminal)         AGENT runs commands on VPS
PHASE F: Mixed                    AGENT verifies from both sides
```

### Playwright MCP Tools Used

| Tool | When |
|------|------|
| `browser_navigate` | Open Hetzner console URLs |
| `browser_snapshot` | Read page state (DOM), extract data (IPs, status) |
| `browser_take_screenshot` | Visual proof of each step |
| `browser_click` | Select options, click buttons |
| `browser_type` | Fill form fields (project name, server name, SSH key) |
| `browser_wait_for` | Wait for server provisioning to complete |
| `browser_evaluate` | Extract specific values from page (IP address) |

### Human-in-the-Loop Moments

| Step | Why |
|------|-----|
| Login + 2FA | Security - agent never handles credentials |
| Confirm server creation | Cost - EUR 3.99/mo commitment |
| Tailscale auth link | Security - account pairing |

## Veto Conditions

- **User not logged into Hetzner** -> STOP. Agent cannot handle login/2FA.
- **Tailscale ping fails from desktop** -> STOP. No mesh = no secure access.
- **Gateway /health not OK** -> STOP. Check journalctl for errors.
- **VPS has less than 4GB RAM** -> STOP. CX22 minimum.
- **Root SSH still enabled** -> STOP. Security violation.
- **Port 18789 reachable from public internet** -> STOP. Loopback only. [SOURCE: steipete ST_002]
- **Password authentication enabled** -> STOP. Keys only.

## Cost Reference

| Hetzner Plan | vCPU | RAM | SSD | Price/mo | Recommendation |
|-------------|------|-----|-----|----------|----------------|
| CX22 | 2 | 4GB | 40GB NVMe | EUR 3.99 | Minimum for OpenClaw |
| CX32 | 4 | 8GB | 80GB NVMe | EUR 7.49 | If running N8N + Portainer too |
| CX42 | 8 | 16GB | 160GB NVMe | EUR 14.99 | Heavy usage, many channels |

4GB is sufficient for: OpenClaw gateway + 1-2 channels + Docker sandbox.
If adding N8N + Portainer on same VPS, consider CX32 (8GB).

## Notes

Source: OPENCLAW-WHITELABEL-INSTALL-GUIDE.md Phases 1-3.
Playwright MCP available via `mcp__playwright__*` tools (already configured in .claude/settings.local.json).
Agent never handles user credentials - user logs in, agent automates the rest.
