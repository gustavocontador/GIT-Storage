# Title Quality Checklist

> **Owner**: @title-qa

## 1. Voice DNA (30 points)

The title must sound like the creator Henrique wrote it — direct, real, family-first.

- [ ] **No banned words** (0 or -30): Title contains NONE of the following: unlimited, revolutionary, passive income, get rich, hack, guru, secret (clickbait), easy money, no work, autopilot, set and forget, guaranteed, never fail, foolproof, risk-free, grind, crush it, beast mode. *Instant failure if any banned word is present.*
- [ ] **Direct, no-BS tone** (0-10): Sounds like a friend giving you real talk, not a guru selling a dream. No hype, no fluff, no corporate jargon. Would the creator say this at a BBQ?
- [ ] **Family-first framing where applicable** (0-10): If the topic relates to time, money, or lifestyle, the title acknowledges that the viewer has people depending on them. Not forced — only where it naturally fits.
- [ ] **brand vocabulary present** (0-10): At least one brand vocabulary word used naturally: bridge, momentum, system, foundation, build, stack, method, framework, path, runway. Do NOT force vocabulary where it sounds unnatural.

**Section Score**: ___/30

## 2. Title Mechanics (25 points)

The title must be structurally sound and optimized for YouTube's display.

- [ ] **Length: 40-60 characters optimal** (0-8): The sweet spot for full visibility across all devices. 61-70 is acceptable. Over 70 is a flag. Under 30 is too thin.
- [ ] **First 3 words are compelling** (0-7): On mobile, titles truncate. The first 3 words must carry enough weight to stop the scroll even if the rest is cut off. Test: cover everything after the third word — is it still interesting?
- [ ] **Easy to read aloud** (0-5): Read the title out loud. Does it flow naturally in one breath? No tongue twisters, no awkward phrasing, no unnatural word order.
- [ ] **No jargon or insider language** (0-5): The Working Professional is smart but may not know YouTube creator jargon. No "CTR," "RPM," "algorithm," "niche down," or other creator-insider terms unless the video specifically teaches that concept.

**Section Score**: ___/25

---

## 3. Click Psychology (25 points)

The title must create an irresistible reason to click.

- [ ] **Clear hook/trigger mechanism** (0-8): Can you name the SPECIFIC psychological mechanism this title uses? (curiosity gap, loss aversion, social proof, value promise, pattern interrupt, identity activation, etc.) If you cannot name it, the hook is too weak.
- [ ] **Creates specific curiosity or value** (0-7): The title must create SPECIFIC interest, not vague intrigue. "A great method" = vague. "The method that replaced my salary in 6 months" = specific.
- [ ] **Would stop YOUR scroll** (0-5): The QA agent must honestly answer: if I were the target audience, scrolling through my YouTube feed at 11 PM after putting the kids to bed, would THIS title make me stop? Be ruthlessly honest.
- [ ] **Passes the screenshot test** (0-5): If someone screenshotted just this title (no thumbnail, no channel name, no context) and sent it to a friend, would the friend want to find this video? The title must be compelling in complete isolation.

**Section Score**: ___/25

---

## 4. Audience Alignment (10 points)

The title must speak directly to the Working Professional.

- [ ] **Speaks to the Working Professional** (0-4): The viewer is 30+, in a corporate job, has a family, feels stuck, wants a way out that does not risk everything. Does this title feel like it was written FOR them?
- [ ] **Respects intelligence** (0-3): No dumbing down, no condescension, no "anyone can do it" energy. These are smart professionals who have been burned by empty promises. Treat them as equals.
- [ ] **Honest about timelines** (0-3): No implication of overnight success. If a timeframe is mentioned, it must be realistic. "30 days to first revenue" is honest. "30 days to quit your job" is not.

**Section Score**: ___/10

---

## 5. Thumbnail Synergy (10 points)

The title must work WITH a thumbnail, not independently.

- [ ] **Title + thumbnail tell a complete story** (0-4): Together, the title and thumbnail should create a narrative that neither could create alone. The thumbnail shows the WHAT, the title explains the WHY (or vice versa).
- [ ] **Title does NOT repeat thumbnail text** (0-3): If the thumbnail contains text, the title must say something DIFFERENT. Redundancy wastes valuable real estate and signals amateur execution.
- [ ] **Combined curiosity is greater than individual parts** (0-3): The pairing of title + thumbnail should create MORE curiosity than either element alone. 1 + 1 = 3, not 2.

**Section Score**: ___/10
