## 1. Research Design Patterns

### 1.1 Qualitative Research

| Method | When to Use | Sample Size | Duration |
|--------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Interviews (semi-structured) | Deep understanding of experiences | 15-30 participants | 2-4 months |
| Focus Groups | Group dynamics, shared experiences | 4-6 groups (6-10 per group) | 1-2 months |
| Ethnography | Cultural practices, immersive study | 1-3 sites | 6-12 months |
| Case Study | In-depth, bounded system analysis | 1-5 cases | 3-6 months |
| Grounded Theory | Theory generation from data | 20-60 participants | 4-8 months |
| Phenomenology | Lived experience of a phenomenon | 5-25 participants | 3-6 months |

**Data Analysis Methods:**
- Thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006)
- Content analysis (qualitative coding)
- Narrative analysis
- Discourse analysis
- Framework analysis

### 1.2 Quantitative Research

| Design | When to Use | Min Sample | Key Test |
|--------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Experimental (RCT) | Causal inference | Power analysis (often N>100) | t-test, ANOVA |
| Quasi-experimental | No randomization possible | Power analysis | ANCOVA, DiD |
| Survey (cross-sectional) | Prevalence, correlations | N>200 recommended | Regression, SEM |
| Survey (longitudinal) | Change over time | N>100 per wave | Mixed models, GEE |
| Correlational | Relationship between variables | N>50 | Pearson/Spearman, regression |

**Statistical Analysis Methods:**
- Descriptive statistics (mean, SD, frequencies)
- Inferential statistics (t-test, ANOVA, chi-square)
- Regression (linear, logistic, multiple)
- Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)
- Factor Analysis (EFA/CFA)
- Multilevel modeling

### 1.3 Mixed-Methods Research

| Design | Structure | When to Use |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Convergent | QUAL + QUANT simultaneously | Corroborate findings |
| Explanatory Sequential | QUANT → QUAL | Explain quantitative results |
| Exploratory Sequential | QUAL → QUANT | Develop instrument from qualitative data |
| Embedded | One within another | Secondary data enriches primary |

## 2. Research Question Frameworks

### SMART Criteria
- **S**pecific: Clear, focused question
- **M**easurable: Variables can be operationalized
- **A**chievable: Feasible with available resources
- **R**elevant: Contributes to the field
- **T**ime-bound: Can be answered within timeline

### PICO Framework (for intervention studies)
- **P**opulation: Who are the participants?
- **I**ntervention: What treatment/exposure?
- **C**omparison: What alternative?
- **O**utcome: What is measured?

### SPIDER Framework (for qualitative/mixed)
- **S**ample: Who are the participants?
- **P**henomenon of **I**nterest: What is being studied?
- **D**esign: What methodology?
- **E**valuation: What outcomes?
- **R**esearch type: Qualitative/quantitative/mixed?

## 3. IMRaD Paper Structure

| Section | Content | Tense | Length |
|---------|---------|-------|--------|
| **Title** | Concise, informative, keywords | — | 10-15 words |
| **Abstract** | Background, methods, results, conclusion | Past (methods/results), Present (conclusion) | 150-300 words |
| **Introduction** | Context, gap, research question, significance | Present (general), Past (prior studies) | 10-15% of paper |
| **Methods** | Design, participants, procedures, analysis | Past | 20-25% of paper |
| **Results** | Findings, tables, figures | Past | 20-25% of paper |
| **Discussion** | Interpretation, limitations, implications | Present (interpretation), Past (findings) | 25-30% of paper |
| **References** | All cited sources | — | — |

### Writing Tips
- Introduction: Funnel structure (broad → narrow → research question)
- Methods: Enough detail to replicate the study
- Results: Report findings WITHOUT interpretation
- Discussion: Relate findings to prior literature, address limitations first

## 4. Ethics in Research

### IRB/CEP Approval Requirements
- Informed consent documentation
- Data privacy and anonymization plan
- Risk-benefit assessment
- Vulnerable population protections (if applicable)
- Data storage and destruction plan

### Publication Ethics
- Authorship: ICMJE criteria (substantial contribution + drafting + final approval + accountability)
- Conflicts of interest: Disclose all financial/personal relationships
- Plagiarism: Zero tolerance (Turnitin < 15% similarity excluding references)
- Self-plagiarism: Cite own prior work, don't recycle text
- Data fabrication/falsification: Absolute prohibition

### Pre-registration
- **PROSPERO**: Systematic reviews (mandatory for publication in many journals)
- **OSF**: General research (increasing expectation in social sciences)
- **ClinicalTrials.gov**: Clinical trials (mandatory)

## 5. Best Practices

### Research Design
- Start with clear, SMART research questions
- Pre-register protocol when possible
- Get ethics approval BEFORE data collection
- Plan adequate sample size (power analysis for quantitative)
- Pilot test instruments and procedures

### Data Collection
- Train data collectors for consistency
- Document all procedures in detail
- Use validated instruments when available
- Maintain audit trail

### Data Analysis
- Follow pre-registered analysis plan
- Report ALL results (not just significant ones)
- Use appropriate statistical tests for data type
- Check assumptions before running tests
- Report effect sizes alongside p-values

### Writing
- Follow IMRaD strictly
- Cite as you write (don't wait until the end)
- One idea per paragraph with clear topic sentence
- Use active voice when possible
- Avoid overclaiming ("suggests" not "proves")

## 6. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Impact | Prevention |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Vague research questions | Unfocused research, weak conclusions | Use SMART/PICO frameworks |
| Methodology too ambitious | Timeline/budget overrun | Pilot test, consult advisor |
| Ignoring ethics | Career-ending consequences | Ethics approval BEFORE data collection |
| Cherry-picking results | Bias, retraction risk | Pre-register, report all findings |
| Poor sample size | Underpowered study, non-significant results | A priori power analysis |
| Missing limitations | Reviewer rejection | Proactively address in Discussion |
| Inconsistent tense | Unprofessional writing | Follow IMRaD tense conventions |
| Overclaiming | Loss of credibility | Use hedging language appropriately |
