# DNA Mental 8-Layer Framework Reference

## Overview

DNA Mental is an 8-layer cognitive extraction framework for creating high-fidelity AI clones. Each layer captures a different depth of the subject's cognitive architecture.

## Layer Architecture

### Observable Layers (1-4)
Extracted from behavioral evidence, content analysis, and direct observation.

| Layer | Name | What It Captures | Confidence Target |
|-------|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Behavioral Patterns | Work habits, learning, decision speed, social patterns | 90%+ |
| 2 | Communication Style | Vocabulary, tone, metaphors, audience adaptation | 95%+ |
| 3 | Routines & Habits | Daily routines, creative rituals, recovery patterns | 75%+ |
| 4 | Recognition Patterns | Domain expertise boundaries, signature insights | 90%+ |

### Cognitive Layer (5)
Bridge between observable and deep identity.

| Layer | Name | What It Captures | Confidence Target |
|-------|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 5 | Mental Models | Reasoning frameworks, decision heuristics, conceptual tools | 95%+ |

### Deep Identity Layers (6-8)
Require triangulation (3+ independent sources). Human checkpoint mandatory.

| Layer | Name | What It Captures | Confidence Target |
|-------|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 6 | Values Hierarchy | Ranked values (scored), non-negotiables, trade-offs | 100% (if self-analysis available) |
| 7 | Core Obsessions | Existential drives, "why behind the why", recurring themes | 100% (if self-analysis available) |
| 8 | Productive Paradoxes | Generative tensions, apparent contradictions as superpowers | 95%+ |

## Extraction Order

1. **Layers 1-4** (observable) — Extract from any quality source
2. **Layer 5** (cognitive) — Extract from courses, frameworks, decision examples
3. **Layer 6** (values) — Extract from self-analysis, then triangulate
4. **Layer 7** (obsessions) — Extract from themes across all content
5. **Layer 8** (paradoxes) — Extract from contradictions in profile vs. behavior

## Triangulation Rules (Layers 5-8)

- Minimum 3 independent sources per claim
- Evidence must be documented (citation/reference)
- Confidence: Alta (3+ sources agree), Media (2 sources), Baixa (1 source + inference)
- Human checkpoint before consolidating layers 6, 7, 8

## Synthesis Outputs

- `identity-core.yaml` — Synthesized from layers 6-8
- `cognitive-spec.yaml` — Full 8-layer specification
- Both feed into Phase 4 (KB) and Phase 5 (Prompt Engineering)
