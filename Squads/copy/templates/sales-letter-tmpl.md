## Usage Notes

- Fill in all `{placeholders}` with specific copy
- Choose ONE opening style (don't use all four)
- P.S. sections are read by 90% of scanners — make them count
- The headline is worth 80% of the effort — test multiple versions
- Read the final letter aloud — if it doesn't sound natural, rewrite
