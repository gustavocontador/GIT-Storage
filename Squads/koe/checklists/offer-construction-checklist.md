## 1. Dream Outcome Clarity

```yaml
dream_outcome:
  definition:
    - [ ] Dream outcome stated in one sentence (customer's words, not yours)
    - [ ] Outcome is specific and measurable (not vague "improve your life")
    - [ ] Outcome addresses a transformation, not just information delivery
    - [ ] Target audience can immediately say "yes, that's what I want"
  resonance:
    - [ ] Dream outcome connects to identity change (who they become, not just what they get)
    - [ ] Outcome is framed as inevitable with the right system (not luck-dependent)
    - [ ] Language uses Dan Koe's "solve your own problem, package the solution" frame
  proof:
    - [ ] Creator has achieved or is actively living the dream outcome
    - [ ] At least 3 proof points (results, testimonials, case studies)
    - [ ] Proof is specific (numbers, timelines, before/after)
```

## 2. Risk Reversal

```yaml
risk_reversal:
  guarantee_presence:
    - [ ] Some form of guarantee or risk reversal explicitly stated
    - [ ] Guarantee type matches offer type (money-back, results-based, access-based)
    - [ ] Guarantee conditions are clear and fair
  trust_building:
    - [ ] Risk reversal removes the #1 objection
    - [ ] Buyer feels protected, not trapped
    - [ ] Guarantee language is confident, not defensive
  sustainability:
    - [ ] Guarantee doesn't attract freeloaders (conditions filter serious buyers)
    - [ ] Refund rate projected at < 5% with this guarantee structure
    - [ ] Guarantee is operationally deliverable (not a promise you can't keep)
```

---

## 3. Value > Price Equation

```yaml
value_equation:
  perceived_value:
    - [ ] Total perceived value is >= 5x the asking price
    - [ ] Value is broken down into visible components (not one lump)
    - [ ] Each component has an individual price anchor
  value_stacking:
    - [ ] Core offer clearly defined
    - [ ] At least 2 bonuses that enhance (not pad) the core
    - [ ] Bonuses solve adjacent problems the buyer will face
    - [ ] "Fast action" or time-sensitive bonus included
  pricing_logic:
    - [ ] Price positioned relative to cost of NOT solving the problem
    - [ ] Price is in the "accessible but not cheap" range for target audience
    - [ ] Payment options available (if price > $500)
```

---

## 4. Urgency & Scarcity (Authentic)

```yaml
urgency_scarcity:
  authenticity:
    - [ ] Urgency is REAL (not manufactured countdown timers)
    - [ ] Scarcity is REAL (limited spots, limited time, genuine reason)
    - [ ] If evergreen, urgency comes from buyer's situation, not fake deadlines
  implementation:
    - [ ] Deadline or limit clearly communicated
    - [ ] Reason for limit explained (builds trust)
    - [ ] Post-deadline plan exists (waitlist, higher price, next cohort)
  koe_alignment:
    - [ ] Urgency doesn't use sleazy sales tactics
    - [ ] Offer can be sold through education, not pressure
    - [ ] Content naturally leads to offer (not hard pivot)
```

---

## 5. One-Person Business Viability

```yaml
opb_viability:
  delivery_model:
    - [ ] Offer can be delivered without hiring a team
    - [ ] Digital-first delivery (scalable without physical constraints)
    - [ ] Time investment per customer < 2 hours (or fully automated)
  sovereignty:
    - [ ] Creator maintains creative freedom with this offer
    - [ ] Offer doesn't create dependency on external platforms
    - [ ] Revenue is not capped by time (leverage exists)
  simplicity:
    - [ ] Offer can be explained in 30 seconds
    - [ ] Buyer journey has <= 3 steps from awareness to purchase
    - [ ] Tech stack is minimal and maintainable by one person
```

### Thresholds
- **PASS**: >= 80 points (80%)
- **CONDITIONAL**: >= 60 points (60%)
- **FAIL**: < 60 points

### If FAIL
1. Rewrite dream outcome using customer interviews or DM conversations — it must resonate instantly
2. Rebuild value stack ensuring perceived value >= 5x price with individually anchored components
3. Add or strengthen risk reversal — every irresistible offer needs one
4. Remove any fake urgency — replace with authentic scarcity or situation-based urgency
