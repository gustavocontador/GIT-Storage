## 1. Naming Validation

```yaml
naming:
  framework_name:
    - [ ] Big Idea has a proprietary name (2-4 words)
    - [ ] Name is intuitive — hints at the concept without explanation
    - [ ] Name is unique — no collision with existing popular frameworks
    - [ ] Name works as a content title, course section, or book chapter
  memorability:
    - [ ] Name passes the "cocktail party test" (someone could repeat it accurately)
    - [ ] Name is not an acronym (unless the acronym spells something meaningful)
    - [ ] Name creates visual or emotional association
```

---

## 2. Contrarian Position

```yaml
contrarian:
  clarity:
    - [ ] Conventional wisdom clearly stated: "Most people believe X"
    - [ ] Contrarian position clearly stated: "I argue Y instead"
    - [ ] The gap between X and Y creates productive tension
    - [ ] The contrarian position is genuinely believed (not manufactured for engagement)
  evidence:
    - [ ] At least 3 evidence points supporting the contrarian position
    - [ ] Evidence includes: personal experience, data, and external authority
    - [ ] Counter-arguments to the contrarian position anticipated
    - [ ] Counter-arguments addressed without dismissing them
```

---

## 3. One-Sentence Summary

```yaml
one_sentence:
  compression:
    - [ ] Big Idea expressible in exactly ONE sentence
    - [ ] Sentence is under 20 words
    - [ ] Sentence includes: who benefits + what changes + why it matters
    - [ ] Sentence can be used as a subtitle or meta-description
  test:
    - [ ] Someone unfamiliar with the topic understands the sentence
    - [ ] The sentence makes the reader want to know more
    - [ ] The sentence does NOT need a follow-up sentence to make sense
```

---

## 4. Depth Validation

```yaml
depth:
  iceberg_check:
    - [ ] Surface layer (one-sentence) is simple and accessible
    - [ ] Depth layer has 3+ supporting sources
    - [ ] Depth explains the mechanism (HOW it works)
    - [ ] Depth explains the evidence (WHY we know it works)
  content_sufficiency:
    - [ ] Enough depth to fill a 10+ minute YouTube video
    - [ ] Enough depth to fill a 1500+ word newsletter
    - [ ] Enough depth to fill a 30-60 minute course module
    - [ ] Depth includes: theory + practice + examples + objections
```

## 5. Content Readiness Gate

```yaml
content_readiness:
  pre_creation_checklist:
    - [ ] Big Idea named — YES/NO
    - [ ] Contrarian angle defined — YES/NO
    - [ ] One-sentence summary written — YES/NO
    - [ ] Iceberg depth validated — YES/NO
    - [ ] APAG structure mappable — YES/NO
  veto_conditions:
    - [ ] VETO if Big Idea cannot be named
    - [ ] VETO if no contrarian angle exists (agreeing with consensus is not a Big Idea)
    - [ ] VETO if one-sentence summary requires more than one sentence
    - [ ] VETO if depth is insufficient for target format
```

---

## 6. Format-Specific Readiness

```yaml
format_readiness:
  course_module:
    - [ ] Learning objective defined (what student will be able to DO after)
    - [ ] Module fits within broader course arc
    - [ ] Exercises or assignments derivable from the Big Idea
    - [ ] Assessment criteria definable
  youtube_script:
    - [ ] Thumbnail concept derivable from the Big Idea
    - [ ] First 30 seconds script-ready (hook from Big Idea)
    - [ ] Story or demonstration available to illustrate the concept
    - [ ] CTA naturally flows from the content
  newsletter:
    - [ ] Subject line derivable from the Big Idea
    - [ ] APAG structure maps cleanly to newsletter format
    - [ ] Content cascade pieces identifiable
```

## Scoring

| Category | Items | Points Each | Max |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----|
| Critical — Naming, Contrarian & One-Sentence | 14 | 3 | 42 |
| Standard — Depth & Content Readiness | 13 | 2 | 26 |
| Bonus — Format-Specific Readiness | 11 | 1 | 11 |
| **TOTAL** | **38** | | **79** |

### Thresholds
- **PASS**: >= 63 points (80%)
- **CONDITIONAL**: >= 47 points (60%)
- **FAIL**: < 47 points

### If FAIL
1. Go back to naming: if you cannot name it, you do not understand it well enough
2. Write the contrarian statement: "Everyone thinks X, but actually Y because Z"
3. Compress to one sentence: if it takes two sentences, you have two ideas (pick one)
4. Do NOT start writing content until all 5 pre-creation items are YES — creating content from a fuzzy Big Idea wastes deep work time
