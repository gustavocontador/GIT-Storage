2. Have the title and thumbnail concept available (if they exist).
3. Work through each section, checking items honestly.
4. Record specific evidence for each item (quote the text, not just "yes").
5. Calculate the hook score at the end.

## 1. PVSS FRAMEWORK ELEMENTS

Check whether each PVSS element is present in the hook:

| Element        | Present? | Text Evidence (quote from hook)       | Quality (1-10) |
|----------------|----------|---------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **P** Preview  | Yes / No | "___"                                 | ___             |
| **V** Value    | Yes / No | "___"                                 | ___             |

### PVSS Validation

- [ ] **(Warning)** Preview element present — viewer knows what they will get.
- [ ] **(Warning)** Value element present — viewer understands why it matters to them.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Social proof present — credentials, data, or results establish trust.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Story element present — a narrative hook or case study teaser engages emotion.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** All 4 PVSS elements are present (even briefly).

## 2. TTS FRAMEWORK ELEMENTS

Check whether each TTS element is present:

| Element          | Present? | Text Evidence (quote from hook)     | Quality (1-10) |
|------------------|----------|-------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **T** Tease      | Yes / No | "___"                               | ___             |

## 3. TITLE/THUMBNAIL ALIGNMENT

### Title Alignment

## 4. THE 8-SECOND TEST

The "8-second test" simulates the critical first moments where a viewer decides to stay or leave.

### Test: Read only the first 8 seconds of the hook aloud.

| Question                                              | Answer    |

| Is there a reason to care after 8 seconds?            | Yes / No  |
| Does it feel different from other videos on this topic?| Yes / No  |
| Is there zero wasted time in these 8 seconds?         | Yes / No  |

## 6. FIRST 5 SECONDS — DEAD TIME CHECK

Analyze the very first 5 seconds for any wasted time:

| Second | Content                                    | Status                    |
|--------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 0-1    | "___"                                      | Active / Dead Time        |
| 1-2    | "___"                                      | Active / Dead Time        |
| 2-3    | "___"                                      | Active / Dead Time        |
| 3-4    | "___"                                      | Active / Dead Time        |
| 4-5    | "___"                                      | Active / Dead Time        |

### Dead Time Validation

- [ ] **(Warning)** No "So...", "Um...", "Alright...", or similar stall words.
- [ ] **(Warning)** No logo intro, channel intro, or branding before the hook.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** The first syllable is a power word or the start of a compelling statement.

## 7. AUTHORITY / PROOF WITHIN 15 SECONDS

Check whether the viewer has a reason to trust the creator within 15 seconds:

| Authority Signal                              | Present? | Text Evidence            |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------|--------------------------|
| Personal experience stated                    | Yes / No | "___"                    |
| Credentials mentioned                         | Yes / No | "___"                    |
| Data or research cited                        | Yes / No | "___"                    |
| Results or outcomes shared                    | Yes / No | "___"                    |
| Third-party validation referenced             | Yes / No | "___"                    |
| Demonstrated knowledge through specificity    | Yes / No | "___"                    |

### Authority Validation

- [ ] **(Warning)** At least one authority/proof signal is present within 15 seconds.
- [ ] **(Warning)** The proof signal is specific (not vague — "I've studied this for years" is weak; "$2M in results" is strong).
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Proof signal is embedded naturally (not "Hi, I'm [name] and I have [credentials]").
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Multiple authority signals are present (stacked proof).

## 8. OPEN LOOP IN HOOK

Check whether at least one open loop is planted in the hook:

| Loop                    | Present? | Text Evidence                    | Type               |
|-------------------------|----------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| Master Loop (Grand Payoff) | Yes / No | "___"                         | ___                 |
| Secondary Loop 1        | Yes / No | "___"                            | ___                 |
| Secondary Loop 2        | Yes / No | "___"                            | ___                 |

### Open Loop Validation

- [ ] **(Critical)** At least one open loop is planted in the hook.
- [ ] **(Critical)** The Master Loop (grand payoff tease) is opened — viewer knows they need to watch to the end.
- [ ] **(Warning)** The open loop creates genuine curiosity (not a weak tease).
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** 2-3 loops are opened in the hook (layered curiosity).
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Loops target different curiosity types (what, why, how).

---

## 9. PROMISE SPECIFICITY

Evaluate how specific the hook's promise is:

| Specificity Level | Description                                              | Example                                    |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1 - Vague         | No clear promise                                        | "Let's talk about investing"               |
| 2 - Generic        | Promise is broad                                       | "I'll show you how to invest better"       |
| 3 - Moderate       | Promise has some specificity                           | "I'll show you 3 investment strategies"    |
| 4 - Specific       | Promise is clear and measurable                        | "3 strategies that turned $1K into $50K"   |
| 5 - Ultra-Specific  | Promise is precise, unique, and compelling            | "The exact 3-step DCA strategy I used to turn $1,000 into $47,382 in 18 months" |

### Promise Assessment

| Question                                         | Answer     |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------|
| What is the hook's promise?                      | "___"      |
| Specificity level (1-5)?                         | ___        |
| Is the promise achievable/deliverable?           | Yes / No   |
| Is the promise unique (not every channel says this)? | Yes / No |

### Promise Validation

- [ ] **(Critical)** A clear promise is present in the hook (viewer knows what they'll get).
- [ ] **(Critical)** The promise is specific — level 3 or above.
- [ ] **(Warning)** The promise is unique or differentiated from competitors.
- [ ] **(Warning)** The promise is deliverable — the script actually delivers on it.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** The promise includes a number, timeframe, or measurable outcome.
