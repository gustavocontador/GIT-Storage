# Write Newsletter

```yaml
id: write-newsletter
execution_type: Agent
purpose: Write a newsletter edition that combines a single deep insight with personal storytelling, building trust and moving subscribers closer to booking Next Step.
executor: @nicolas-cole
inputs:
  - Single insight or topic for this edition
  - Audience segment (new subscribers vs. engaged readers)
  - Recent content performance (what resonated this week)
  - Personal story or experience to weave in
preconditions:
  - Newsletter platform set up (Substack or equivalent)
  - Content pillar for this edition identified
  - At least 1 personal story or client example available
steps:
  1. Choose the single insight (Art of Focus):
     - One newsletter = one idea, explored deeply
     - The reader should leave with exactly one "aha"
     - Test: Can you summarize the insight in 1 sentence?
  2. Write the cold open (first 2-3 sentences):
     - Start mid-action or mid-thought (no "Oi, tudo bem?")
     - Options: Start with a scene, a question, a bold statement, or a confession
     - The cold open determines if they read or close
     - Example: "Terça-feira, 23h. Terceiro cafe. Planilha aberta. Nenhuma decisao tomada."
  3. Build the 3-section body:
     - Section 1 — The Problem (resonate):
       - Paint the situation your reader lives in
       - Use specific details that make them think "he's talking about me"
       - Keep it under 150 words
     - Section 2 — The Insight (reveal):
       - Introduce the shift in perspective
       - Apply Rate of Revelation (build to the "aha" moment)
       - Use a story, metaphor, or example to make it concrete
       - This is the meat — 200-300 words
     - Section 3 — The Application (empower):
       - "Here's what this means for you"
       - 1-3 practical steps or questions to reflect on
       - Make it actionable TODAY (not "someday")
       - Keep it under 150 words
  4. Add the personal element (20% rule):
     - Weave in a personal story, client example, or behind-the-scenes moment
     - This builds the parasocial relationship
     - Be vulnerable but not performative
     - Connected to the insight (not random personal update)
  5. Write the CTA:
     - Primary: Reply to this email (engagement signal)
     - Secondary: Share with someone who needs this
     - Tertiary (when appropriate): Next Step link
     - Never more than 1 hard CTA per newsletter
  6. Write the subject line (last step):
     - 3-5 word subject lines outperform long ones
     - Curiosity > clickbait
     - Test: Would this survive a crowded inbox?
  7. Final polish:
     - Read aloud from start to finish
     - Cut 20% of the words (first draft is always too long)
     - Check: Does every paragraph move the reader forward?
outputs:
  - Complete newsletter draft with:
    - Subject line (+ 2 alternatives)
    - Preview text (40-90 characters)
    - Cold open
    - 3-section body
    - Personal element woven in
    - CTA
    - Estimated read time
    - Word count (target: 600-900 words)
validation:
  - Single insight is clear and specific (not vague)
  - Cold open hooks within first 2 sentences
  - Personal element feels authentic (not forced)
  - Body sections flow logically (problem → insight → application)
  - CTA is natural (not salesy)
  - Word count between 600-900 (respect reader's time)
  - Subject line is under 50 characters and creates curiosity
  - Reads like Tiago talking to a friend (direto, sem verniz, pratico)
```
