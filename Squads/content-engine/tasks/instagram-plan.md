# Instagram Plan

```yaml
id: instagram-plan
execution_type: Agent
purpose: Create a 2-week Instagram content plan using the ANC Funnel (Attract-Nurture-Convert) with strategic content mix across feed, Reels, Stories, and carousel formats.
executor: @vanessa-lau
inputs:
  - Content pillars and weekly topics
  - Brand visual identity guidelines
  - Current Instagram analytics (reach, engagement, saves, shares, DMs)
  - Lead magnet or conversion offer (Next Step — beta gratuito)
preconditions:
  - Instagram account is active with posting history
  - Content pillars defined
  - Visual identity established (or basic guidelines)
  - Lead magnet or CTA destination exists
steps:
  1. Define ANC content mix ratio:
     - Attract (40%): Content that reaches NEW people (Reels, trending, shareable)
     - Nurture (40%): Content that builds trust with EXISTING followers (carousels, stories, deep posts)
     - Convert (20%): Content that drives ACTION (testimonials, CTA posts, offer posts)
     - For 2 weeks (14 days), approx: 6 Attract, 6 Nurture, 2 Convert
  2. Plan the feed content (10-14 posts over 2 weeks):
     - Reels (4-6): Short-form video, trending audio, hook-first
     - Carousels (3-4): Educational slides, story sequences, tactical tips
     - Single image posts (2-3): Quote graphics, bold statements, testimonials
     - Each post tagged: Attract (A), Nurture (N), or Convert (C)
  3. Plan the feed grid aesthetic:
     - Alternate between Reels, carousels, and single posts
     - Visual consistency (colors, fonts, style)
     - Grid view should look cohesive when viewed as a whole
  4. Plan Stories sequence (daily):
     - Monday: Behind-the-scenes of work/content creation
     - Tuesday: Quick tip or insight (educational)
     - Wednesday: Poll or question (engagement driver)
     - Thursday: Client story or testimonial (social proof)
     - Friday: Personal moment or reflection
     - Saturday: Recommendation or "o que estou lendo/ouvindo"
     - Sunday: Week recap or preview
     - Each day: 3-5 story frames, always end with engagement sticker
  5. Plan Reels topics (4-6 total):
     - At least 2 "Attract" Reels (broad appeal, shareable)
     - At least 1 "Nurture" Reel (deeper insight for followers)
     - At least 1 "Convert" Reel (testimonial or direct offer)
     - Each Reel: Hook in first 1.5 seconds, under 60 seconds, loop-friendly
  6. Apply 3x3 Brand Alignment check:
     - 3 Visual elements: Consistent colors, fonts, layout
     - 3 Voice elements: Same tone, vocabulary, energy level
     - 3 Value elements: Each post delivers education, inspiration, or action
  7. Set posting calendar:
     - Best posting times based on analytics
     - Never post same format back-to-back
     - Leave gaps for real-time/spontaneous content
  8. Define engagement strategy:
     - First 30 minutes after posting: Reply to every comment
     - Daily: 15 min engaging with target audience accounts
     - DM strategy for warm leads (respond within 4 hours)
outputs:
  - 2-week Instagram content plan with:
    - Day-by-day calendar (14 days)
    - Each entry: Date, format, ANC tag, topic, hook, CTA
    - Stories plan (daily themes)
    - Reels topics with brief descriptions
    - Grid layout preview
    - Engagement strategy summary
    - Posting times
validation:
  - ANC ratio is approximately 40/40/20
  - No more than 2 consecutive days without a post
  - Stories planned for every day (minimum 3 frames each)
  - At least 4 Reels in the 2-week period
  - Grid alternates formats (no 3 carousels in a row)
  - At least 2 posts directly reference Next Step
  - All content matches Tiago's voice (direto, sem verniz, pratico)
  - Engagement strategy is realistic (not more than 30 min/day total)
