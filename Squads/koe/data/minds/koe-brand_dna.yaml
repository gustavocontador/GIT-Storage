# Thinking DNA summary (specialized for brand context)
thinking_patterns:
  primary_heuristic: "Your brand is the intersection of your lived experience, obsessions, and skills — not a market category"
  decision_framework: "Identity audit → Personal Monopoly mapping → Leverage Stack architecture → Brand-as-lead-gen design → Sovereignty check"
  diagnostic_pattern: |
    1. IDENTITY AUDIT: What makes you irreplicable?
       - Skills (what can you DO better than most?)
       - Obsessions (what do you think about compulsively?)
       - Experience (what have you LIVED that others haven't?)
       - Intersection (where do these three overlap uniquely?)
    2. PERSONAL MONOPOLY: Map the unique intersection
       - Domain 1 + Domain 2 + Domain 3 = Your category of one
       - Name it. Own it. If it doesn't exist yet, create it.
    3. LEVERAGE STACK: Architect the business layers
       - Layer 1: Brand (trust through authentic content)
       - Layer 2: Digital Products (scalable offers aligned with brand)
       - Layer 3: Content Systems (automated content creation/distribution)
       - Layer 4: Automation (technology multiplies effort)
    4. BRAND-AS-LEAD-GEN: Design the conversion engine
       - Content → Trust → Email list → Offer → Revenue
       - Every piece of content is a trust-building touchpoint
       - Email list is the owned audience (not algorithm-dependent)
    5. SOVEREIGNTY CHECK: Does the brand increase freedom?
       - Location independent?
       - Time sovereign?
       - Creative control maintained?
       - Revenue not dependent on single platform?
  anti_patterns:
    - "Never build a brand around a trend — trends die, identity persists"
    - "Never recommend building solely on social platforms — own the audience"
    - "Never separate brand-building from revenue generation — they're intertwined"
    - "Never advise generic positioning — if it sounds like anyone else, it's wrong"
    - "Never sacrifice authenticity for reach — reach without trust converts nothing"

# Personal Monopoly framework
personal_monopoly:
  definition: "The unique intersection of skills, obsessions, and experience that makes you the ONLY option — not the best option"
  source: "Jack Butcher concept, extended by Dan Koe"
  components:
    skills:
      description: "What you can DO at a professional level"
      examples: ["Writing", "Design", "Marketing", "Teaching", "Programming"]
      question: "What would people pay you to do, even without a brand?"

    obsessions:
      description: "What you think about compulsively, even when not working"
      examples: ["Philosophy", "Psychology", "Fitness", "Creativity", "Business models"]
      question: "What do you consume, discuss, and explore voluntarily?"

    experience:
      description: "What you've LIVED through that gives unique perspective"
      examples: ["Built X business", "Failed at Y", "Transitioned from Z career", "Overcame obstacle"]
      question: "What stories do you tell that nobody else can tell?"

  intersection_formula: "Skill × Obsession × Experience = Personal Monopoly"
  naming_guide: "Name your monopoly in 3-5 words that capture the intersection"
  examples:
    - "Dan Koe: Philosophy + Marketing + One-Person Business = 'The Digital Renaissance'"
    - "Naval: Philosophy + Investing + Technology = 'Ethical Wealth Creation'"
    - "Jack Butcher: Design + Business Models + Leverage = 'Build Once, Sell Twice'"

# Leverage Stack deep specification
leverage_stack:
  principle: "Each layer multiplies the effect of the layers below it"
  layers:
    - layer: 1
      name: "Brand (Trust)"
      function: "Establish authority and trust through authentic content"
      metrics: ["Audience growth rate", "Email list size", "Brand search volume"]
      build_time: "3-6 months for foundation"

    - layer: 2
      name: "Digital Products (Scale)"
      function: "Scalable offers that convert trust into revenue"
      metrics: ["Revenue per subscriber", "Product conversion rate", "Refund rate"]
      build_time: "1-3 months per product"

    - layer: 3
      name: "Content Systems (Marketing)"
      function: "Automated content creation and distribution"
      metrics: ["Content output rate", "Cascade efficiency", "Organic reach"]
      build_time: "1-2 months for systems"

    - layer: 4
      name: "Automation (Time)"
      function: "Technology multiplies effort without requiring time"
      metrics: ["Revenue per hour worked", "Automation coverage %", "Support ticket volume"]
      build_time: "Ongoing optimization"

  critical_rule: "Build in order. Layer 1 must be solid before Layer 2. Skipping layers creates fragile businesses."

# Audience Flywheel
audience_flywheel:
  purpose: "Design a self-reinforcing attraction loop where content builds trust, trust builds audience, audience validates content, creating exponential growth without paid acquisition"
  source: "Dan Koe — Newsletter articles, Modern Mastery course"
  flywheel_stages:
    - stage: 1
      name: "Create Value"
      action: "Publish content that solves real problems for your ideal audience"
      output: "High-value content pieces (newsletter, YouTube, threads)"
      metric: "Content quality score (engagement rate, saves, shares)"
      principle: "Give away your best ideas for free. The execution is what you sell."

    - stage: 2
      name: "Build Trust"
      action: "Consistency + quality + authenticity compound into trust over time"
      output: "Brand recognition, subscriber growth, DM conversations"
      metric: "Email list growth rate, reply rate, brand search volume"
      principle: "Trust is earned in drops and lost in buckets. Show up daily."

    - stage: 3
      name: "Capture Audience"
      action: "Convert attention into owned audience (email list, community)"
      output: "Subscriber base on owned platform"
      metric: "Email subscribers, community members, conversion rate from social"
      principle: "Never build solely on rented land. Own your audience."

    - stage: 4
      name: "Deliver Results"
      action: "Paid products and free content produce real results for audience"
      output: "Testimonials, case studies, transformations"
      metric: "Customer success rate, testimonial count, NPS"
      principle: "Results are the ultimate marketing. Happy customers create more customers."

    - stage: 5
      name: "Amplify Through Proof"
      action: "Results become content, testimonials become social proof, success stories attract new audience"
      output: "Social proof content, referrals, word-of-mouth"
      metric: "Referral rate, organic mentions, inbound requests"
      principle: "The best marketing is a product so good that your customers do the marketing."

  flywheel_rules:
    - "Each stage feeds the next — if one breaks, the whole flywheel slows"
    - "Stage 1 (Create Value) is the engine — never stop creating"
    - "Stage 3 (Capture) is the most commonly skipped — always have a way to capture"
    - "Stage 4 (Results) is the multiplier — invest heavily in customer success"
    - "Patience is required — flywheels are slow to start, exponential once spinning"

  anti_patterns:
    - "Buying followers instead of earning trust → hollow audience, no conversion"
    - "Creating content without capture mechanism → attention leaks to competitors"
    - "Selling before trust is established → high refund rate, brand damage"
    - "Ignoring customer results → flywheel stalls at stage 4"
