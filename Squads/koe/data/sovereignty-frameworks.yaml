  # FRAMEWORK 3: Traffic + Offers Equation
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  - id: SF-003
    name: "Traffic + Offers Equation"
    category: "business_fundamentals"
    description: "The fundamental simplification of all business into two variables — the right people seeing your offer. Everything else is a distraction."
    formula: "Business = Traffic (right people seeing) + Offers (right thing offered at right value)"
    components:
      traffic:
        definition: "The flow of the RIGHT people who become aware of your existence"
        key_distinction: "Not just eyeballs — qualified attention from people who need what you offer"
        sources:
          organic:
            - "Content marketing (newsletters, YouTube, social media)"
            - "SEO and search presence"
            - "Community building"
            - "Word of mouth and referrals"
          paid:
            - "Social media ads (targeted to avatar)"
            - "Search ads"
            - "Sponsorships and partnerships"
          borrowed:
            - "Guest appearances on podcasts/channels"
            - "Collaborations with complementary creators"
            - "Joint ventures"
        diagnosis:
          low_traffic: "Nobody sees your offer → focus on content and distribution"
          wrong_traffic: "People see it but don't buy → misaligned audience, fix targeting"
          right_traffic: "Qualified people see and engage → ready for offer optimization"

      offers:
        definition: "The value exchange you propose — what you give in return for money"
        key_distinction: "Not just products — the complete package of value, risk reversal, and transformation"
        components:
          - "Core deliverable (the primary thing they receive)"
          - "Value hierarchy position (entertainment → implementation)"
          - "Risk reversal (guarantee that removes buyer risk)"
          - "Pricing (value-to-price ratio >= 10:1)"
        diagnosis:
          no_offer: "You have traffic but no offer → create first product"
          weak_offer: "People see it but don't buy → strengthen value or add risk reversal"
          strong_offer: "Good conversion rate → scale traffic"

    diagnostic_process:
      - "1. Identify which variable is the bottleneck (Traffic or Offers)"
      - "2. Diagnose the sub-problem within that variable"
      - "3. Apply the appropriate framework (Content Cascade for traffic, Risk Reversal for offers)"
      - "4. Measure and iterate"

    simplification_rule: "When business feels complicated, reduce back to these two variables. 99% of problems are either a traffic problem or an offer problem."

  # FRAMEWORK 4: Digital Economics Principles
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  - id: SF-004
    name: "Digital Economics Principles"
    category: "economic_leverage"
    description: "The unique economic properties of digital businesses that enable one-person operations to achieve outsized results"
    principles:
      - principle: "Marginal Cost Near Zero"
        description: "Once a digital product is created, the cost to serve one additional customer approaches zero"
        implication: "Your 1000th customer costs almost nothing more than your 1st"
        application: "Build digital products (courses, templates, software) that scale without additional production cost"
        example: "A $200 course costs $5,000 to create. Whether 50 or 5,000 people buy it, production cost stays the same."

      - principle: "Scale Without Hiring"
        description: "Digital tools and automation enable scaling revenue without proportionally scaling team"
        implication: "One person with the right systems can serve thousands"
        application: "Invest in automation, self-serve tools, and async communication before hiring"
        example: "Automated email sequences handle sales, onboarding, and support for thousands of customers."

      - principle: "Distribution is Free"
        description: "Social platforms provide free distribution channels — your content reaches people at zero marginal cost"
        implication: "Content marketing is the highest ROI marketing channel for one-person businesses"
        application: "Create content consistently. Let the platforms do the distribution. Own the audience via email."
        example: "One newsletter cascaded into 20+ pieces reaches 100K+ people across platforms — at zero ad spend."

      - principle: "Knowledge as Product"
        description: "Specific knowledge and lived experience can be packaged into infinitely replicable digital products"
        implication: "Your education, experience, and frameworks are scalable assets"
        application: "Package specific knowledge into courses, templates, guides. Your intersection = your product."
        example: "Dan Koe's knowledge of marketing + philosophy + content = Digital Economics course (thousands of students, no inventory)."

      - principle: "Compounding Returns"
        description: "Content, brand, and skills compound over time — each piece makes the next one more effective"
        implication: "The 100th newsletter is exponentially more valuable than the 1st (audience, skill, backlinks, SEO)"
        application: "Play long-term games. Invest in compounding assets (content, email list, brand equity)."
        example: "A creator's year-3 revenue is typically 10x their year-1 revenue, even with same hours invested."

    scoring_criteria:
      per_principle:
        not_leveraged: "0: Not using this principle at all"
        partially_leveraged: "1: Some use but not systematic"
        fully_leveraged: "2: Systematically leveraging this principle"
      overall:
        max_score: "10 (5 principles x 2 points each)"
        sovereign: "8-10: Fully leveraging digital economics"
        developing: "5-7: Good foundation, room to improve"
        underleveraged: "0-4: Missing significant leverage — priority fix"

  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  - id: SF-005
    name: "Future-Present Integration"
    category: "strategic_alignment"
    description: "Three-level system for ensuring every daily action is aligned with long-term vision while maintaining quality presence in the current moment"
    levels:
      - level: "Vision (10-Year Horizon)"
        purpose: "Absolute clarity on the destination — who you're becoming, not just what you're achieving"
        practice:
          frequency: "Monthly deep review"
          technique: "Describe your ideal Tuesday in 10 years — every detail (wake time, activities, people, location, feelings)"
          output: "Living vision document (updated monthly)"
        key_questions:
          - "Who am I becoming in 10 years?"
          - "What does my ideal ordinary day look like?"
          - "What would I regret NOT doing?"
          - "What must be true for this vision to be reality?"
        danger: "Vision without presence = daydreaming (no action, just imagination)"

      - level: "Presence (Today)"
        purpose: "Quality execution in the current moment — deep work, flow state, full engagement"
        practice:
          frequency: "Daily (every working session)"
          technique: "Single-task focus, deep work protocol, device-free blocks"
          output: "Deep work output (content, products, systems)"
        key_questions:
          - "Am I fully engaged with this task?"
          - "Am I doing my best work right now?"
          - "Is this task worthy of my focused attention?"
          - "Am I in flow or in distraction?"
        danger: "Presence without vision = wandering (busy but directionless)"

      - level: "Action (Daily Micro-Progress)"
        purpose: "1% better compounded daily — the bridge between vision and today"
        practice:
          frequency: "Daily alignment check (5 minutes)"
          technique: "Before starting work: 'Does today's plan serve the 10-year vision?'"
          output: "Aligned daily priority list"
        key_questions:
          - "What is the single highest-leverage action I can take today?"
          - "Does this task move me toward the vision or is it maintenance?"
          - "Am I spending time on things that compound?"
          - "What can I eliminate today that doesn't serve the vision?"
        danger: "Action without vision and presence = busy work (efficient at the wrong things)"

    integration_rule: "All three levels must be active simultaneously. Vision sets direction. Presence ensures quality. Action ensures progress."

    alignment_diagnostic:
      - symptom: "Working hard but feeling stuck"
        diagnosis: "Action without Vision — you're efficient at tasks that don't matter"
        fix: "Reconnect to 10-year vision. Cut tasks that don't ladder up."
      - symptom: "Clear vision but no progress"
        diagnosis: "Vision without Action — daydreaming without execution"
        fix: "Define ONE daily action that moves the needle. Do it first."
      - symptom: "Busy and productive but unfulfilled"
        diagnosis: "Action without Presence — doing but not being"
        fix: "Implement deep work protocol. Single-task. Feel the work."
      - symptom: "Scattered, starting many things, finishing few"
        diagnosis: "Action without Vision or Presence — reactive mode"
        fix: "Stop everything. Reconnect to vision. Choose ONE project."
