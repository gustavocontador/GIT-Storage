[2] CLEAN SCRIPT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  → This is the PURE SCRIPT — no annotations, no markers. Ready for:
    - Teleprompter display
    - Voice recording
    - AI narration input (ElevenLabs, Descript, etc.)
    - Client delivery if they only need the words

  → Formatting: One paragraph per thought. Paragraph breaks indicate
    natural pauses or tone shifts. Do NOT use line breaks mid-sentence.

[HOOK — 0:00-0:30]

{Clean script text starts here. Write the entire hook as it would be
spoken, with no annotations. Example:}

I lost $50,000 in a single day — and it wasn't because of a bad
investment. It was because I ignored one simple rule that I'm about
to share with you. If you're holding any amount of money in crypto,
stocks, or even a savings account, this 7-minute video could save
you from the same mistake.

[3] ANNOTATED SCRIPT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  → This is the WORKING SCRIPT with retention mechanics, emotional
    markers, and structural annotations visible. Use this version for:
    - Internal review and scoring
    - Training new specialists
    - Understanding WHY the script works
    - Handoff to editors who need retention context

  → Annotation key:
    [OPEN LOOP]       — A question or promise planted, resolved later
    [LOOP CLOSED]     — The payoff / answer to a previous open loop
    [RE-HOOK]         — Mid-video hook to recapture attention
    [PATTERN INTERRUPT] — Tone shift, visual change, unexpected beat
    [STAKES UP]       — Escalation of what's at risk
    [CTA]             — Call-to-action embedded
    [EMOTION: type]   — Emotional trigger (curiosity/fear/awe/etc.)

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[HOOK — 0:00-0:30]

[EMOTION: shock]
I lost $50,000 in a single day — and it wasn't because of a bad
investment. [OPEN LOOP: "What was the mistake?"] It was because I
ignored one simple rule that I'm about to share with you.

[STAKES UP]
If you're holding any amount of money in crypto, stocks, or even a
savings account, this 7-minute video could save you from the same
mistake.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[INTRO / VALUE PROMISE — 0:30-1:15]

[PATTERN INTERRUPT: tone shift to calm authority]
Here's what we're going to cover. First, I'll explain exactly what
this rule is and why 78% of investors don't know about it.

[OPEN LOOP: "What happens at the end?"]
Then, I'll walk you through the 3-step system I now use to protect
my portfolio — and at the end, I'll reveal the exact moment I
realized my mistake, and how you can avoid it starting today.

[RE-HOOK]
Stick around, because if you've ever felt like the financial system
is rigged against you... you're about to find out why.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[4] OPEN LOOP MAP
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  → Every open loop MUST be resolved. Unresolved loops kill retention
    at the end of the video (viewers feel cheated). This map is used
    by the Script Analyst during quality checks.

| Loop # | Type           | Planted At  | Resolved At | Status   |
|--------|----------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| 1      | Question       | 0:15        | 5:30        | CLOSED   |
| 2      | Promise        | 1:00        | 6:10        | CLOSED   |
| 3      | Curiosity Gap  | 2:45        | 4:50        | CLOSED   |
| 4      | Delayed Reveal | 0:20        | 6:00        | CLOSED   |

  → All loops must show "CLOSED" before delivery. If any loop is
    unresolved, flag it for revision.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[5] PRODUCTION CUES (FACELESS CHANNELS ONLY)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  → Use this section ONLY if Face on Camera = No (faceless).
    For face-on-camera scripts, this section can be omitted or replaced
    with "N/A — Face-to-camera format."

  → These cues guide the editor, motion designer, and narration artist.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TIMESTAMP: 0:00-0:15

[VOICE: shocked, urgent, moderate pace]
"I lost $50,000 in a single day..."

[B-ROLL: stock market crash charts, red numbers falling, 3-5 sec
         clips, high energy]

[MUSIC: cinematic tension, 90 BPM, strings + bass, fade in]

[GRAPHIC: text overlay "$50,000 LOST" in bold red, center screen,
          1.5 sec duration]

[TRANSITION: hard cut to next scene]

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TIMESTAMP: 0:15-0:30

[VOICE: shift to calm authority, slower pace, emphasis on "simple rule"]
"...it was because I ignored one simple rule..."

[B-ROLL: close-up of person writing in notebook, coffee on desk,
         calm aesthetic, warm lighting, 5 sec hold]

[MUSIC: tension fades, soft piano intro, 70 BPM]

[GRAPHIC: none]

[TRANSITION: dissolve, 0.5 sec]

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

{Continue for each major timestamp or scene change...}

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[6] AI NARRATION NOTES (FACELESS CHANNELS ONLY)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  → If the client uses AI narration (ElevenLabs, Descript, Murf, etc.),
    these notes ensure the voiceover sounds natural and engaging.

Target Sentence Length:        12-18 words (max 25 words per sentence)

  → AI voices struggle with sentences >25 words. If a sentence in the
    clean script exceeds this, break it into two sentences with a
    period or em-dash.

Emphasis Markers:

  → Words that should receive vocal emphasis (louder, slower, or
    higher pitch). List them here for the narration artist or AI
    voice settings:
    - "simple rule" (0:20)
    - "$50,000" (0:05, 6:15)
    - "rigged against you" (1:10)

Pause Markers:

  → Where the narration should include a deliberate pause (0.5-1.5 sec)
    for dramatic effect or to let a visual land:
    - After "I lost $50,000 in a single day" (0:08) — 1 sec pause
    - After "you're about to find out why" (1:14) — 0.5 sec pause

Tone Shifts:

  → Map where the vocal tone should change (e.g., from urgent to calm,
    from serious to conversational). Reference timestamps from the
    annotated script section.
    - 0:00-0:30  →  Shocked, urgent
    - 0:30-1:15  →  Calm, authoritative
    - 4:30-6:00  →  Empowering, confident

  → Sum of all 9 dimension scores (0-90 scale).

BONUS: X-FACTOR (+0 to +10):           ____ / 10

  → Does this script have something SPECIAL? An unforgettable hook,
    a unique angle, a story that hits harder than expected? The

    quality that separates good scripts from viral ones.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TOTAL SCORE:                           ____ / 100

  [ ] 60-69   →  WEAK — Major revision required, structural flaws
  [ ] <60     →  REJECT — Start over or escalate to Script Chief

Comments:

  → Specific praise and/or areas for improvement from the Analyst.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[8] RETENTION PREDICTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  → Based on structural analysis and niche benchmarks, the Script
    Analyst provides estimated retention percentages. These are
    PREDICTIONS, not guarantees — actual performance depends on
    thumbnail, title, production quality, and audience.

Predicted Hook Retention (0-30 sec):   ____%

  → Percentage of viewers expected to stay past the first 30 seconds.
    Strong hooks: 65-75%. Weak hooks: 40-50%. Exceptional: 80%+.

Predicted Mid-Point Retention:         ____%

  → Percentage expected to reach the halfway mark. Industry average
    for YouTube: 40-50%. Top-tier scripts: 60%+.

Predicted End Retention (AVD):         ____%

  → Average View Duration as a percentage of total video length.
    YouTube average: 23.7%. Good: 40%+. Exceptional: 50%+.

Retention Risk Zones:

  → Timestamps where retention is predicted to dip based on pacing,
    content density, or structural issues. Flag these for the editor
    to reinforce with visuals or pacing changes.
    - Risk at 2:30-3:00  →  Reason: exposition-heavy, no pattern interrupt
    - Risk at 5:00-5:20  →  Reason: CTA too early, pre-climax

Retention Boosters:

  → Elements in the script predicted to INCREASE retention:
    - Strong open loop at 0:15 (hooks viewers to 5:30 payoff)
    - Emotional story beat at 3:45 (relatability spike)
    - Curiosity gap re-hook at 4:00 (recaptures lost attention)

## Usage Notes for Specialists

When populating this template:

1. **Start with Metadata** -- Calculate word count, readability, and speaking pace AFTER the clean script is finalized. Use tools like Hemingway Editor or readability calculators.

2. **Clean Script First** -- Write the clean script in full before adding annotations. This ensures the script reads naturally when spoken aloud, without being influenced by the markers.

3. **Annotate Deliberately** -- Don't over-annotate. Only mark significant retention mechanics (loops, hooks, stakes) and emotional beats. Too many markers clutter the script.

4. **Verify Open Loops** -- Before delivery, manually confirm every loop in the Open Loop Map is CLOSED. Unresolved loops are the #1 complaint from clients post-launch.

5. **Production Cues = Detail** -- For faceless scripts, the production cues section is critical. Be specific: "warm lighting" is vague; "golden hour aesthetic, 3200K color temp, soft shadows" is actionable.

6. **Quality Score Honesty** -- The scorecard is for internal calibration. If a script scores <80, discuss with the Script Chief before delivery. If it scores <70, revision is mandatory.

7. **Retention Predictions** -- These are educated guesses based on structure. If the brief included competitor URLs, reference their retention curves (if available) to calibrate predictions.
