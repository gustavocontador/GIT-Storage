## 1. The 30-Second Rule

```yaml
thirty_second_rule:
  speed:
    - [ ] Idea captured within 30 seconds of emergence
    - [ ] No deliberation about "worthiness" before capture
    - [ ] Capture tool is always within arm's reach
    - [ ] Capture motion is practiced and automatic (muscle memory)
  friction_audit:
    - [ ] Capture requires fewer than 3 taps/clicks
    - [ ] No login or authentication needed to capture
    - [ ] Capture works offline
    - [ ] Multiple capture paths available (voice, text, photo)
```

---

## 2. Zero-Edit Capture

```yaml
zero_edit:
  raw_thought:
    - [ ] Idea recorded exactly as it appeared in mind
    - [ ] No grammar correction during capture
    - [ ] No restructuring or reorganizing during capture
    - [ ] No self-censorship ("this is dumb" → capture anyway)
  anti_patterns:
    - [ ] No polishing language while capturing
    - [ ] No evaluating potential before capturing
    - [ ] No comparing with existing ideas before capturing
    - [ ] No merging with related ideas during capture (that is processing, not capture)
```

---

## 3. Emotion Logging

```yaml
emotion_logging:
  state_capture:
    - [ ] Emotional state tagged at moment of capture (excited, curious, frustrated, calm)
    - [ ] Intensity level noted (1-5 scale or simple high/medium/low)
    - [ ] Physical sensations noted if relevant (goosebumps, tension, energy surge)
  pattern_value:
    - [ ] High-emotion captures flagged for priority processing
    - [ ] Emotion patterns reviewed during queue processing
    - [ ] Ideas captured during frustration given extra review (often contrarian gold)
    - [ ] Joy/excitement captures validated against post-hoc reality check
```

---

## 4. Context Preservation

```yaml
context_preservation:
  trigger_context:
    - [ ] What triggered the idea is recorded (conversation, reading, observation)
    - [ ] Source material referenced if applicable (book, article, person)
    - [ ] Environmental context noted (location, activity, time)
  temporal_context:
    - [ ] Timestamp auto-recorded
    - [ ] Time of day patterns trackable
    - [ ] Relationship to current project/focus noted if obvious
    - [ ] "What was I thinking about right before this?" captured
```

---

## 5. Judgment Suspension Discipline

```yaml
judgment_suspension:
  mindset:
    - [ ] Treats queue as a "brain dump" not a "curated collection"
    - [ ] Understands: judgment happens during processing, NOT capture
    - [ ] Quantity over quality mindset during capture phase
    - [ ] No idea is too small, too weird, or too obvious to capture
  self_monitoring:
    - [ ] Notices when internal editor activates and overrides it
    - [ ] Captures at least 5 ideas per day (if consuming content)
    - [ ] Reviews capture volume weekly (declining = editor creeping in)
    - [ ] Partners or accountability for capture discipline if needed
```

---

## 6. Capture Quality Metrics

```yaml
quality_metrics:
  completeness:
    - [ ] Each capture has: raw idea + emotion + context (minimum viable capture)
    - [ ] Captures are retrievable and searchable
    - [ ] No orphaned captures (all routed to queue within 24h)
  volume_tracking:
    - [ ] Daily capture count tracked
    - [ ] Capture-to-promotion ratio monitored (healthy: 20-40% promoted)
    - [ ] Zero-capture days investigated (what blocked?)
```

## Scoring

| Category | Items | Points Each | Max |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----|
| Critical — 30-Second Rule & Zero-Edit | 12 | 3 | 36 |
| Standard — Emotion & Context Logging | 10 | 2 | 20 |
| Bonus — Judgment Discipline & Metrics | 10 | 1 | 10 |
| **TOTAL** | **32** | | **66** |

### Thresholds
- **PASS**: >= 53 points (80%)
- **CONDITIONAL**: >= 40 points (60%)
- **FAIL**: < 40 points

### If FAIL
1. Simplify capture to ONE tool, ONE method (text note on phone)
2. Practice 10 captures in 5 minutes — speed over quality
3. Set "capture alarm" 3x/day as reminder to dump whatever is in your head
4. After 3 days, review captures — if all are "polished," you are still editing. Start rawer.
