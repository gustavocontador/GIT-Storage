## 1. Unique Intersection Identification

```yaml
unique_intersection:
  domain_mapping:
    - [ ] Primary domain of expertise identified (the thing you're known for)
    - [ ] Secondary domain identified (the unexpected addition)
    - [ ] Optional third domain identified (the rare differentiator)
    - [ ] All domains are genuine interests/skills (not manufactured for positioning)
  intersection_clarity:
    - [ ] The intersection is expressible in one phrase: "{Domain A} + {Domain B}"
    - [ ] The intersection creates a new category (not just "marketing + fitness")
    - [ ] No one else is known for this exact combination
    - [ ] Intersection feels authentic to the creator's journey
  market_validation:
    - [ ] Audience exists at the intersection (people who care about both domains)
    - [ ] Problem exists at the intersection (unserved need)
    - [ ] Monetization is possible at the intersection (willingness to pay)
```

## 2. Non-Replicability

```yaml
non_replicability:
  personal_story:
    - [ ] Creator's unique journey documented and integrated into brand
    - [ ] Specific experiences that no competitor has shared or lived
    - [ ] Origin story explains WHY this intersection (not just what)
    - [ ] Evolution story shows growth and credibility over time
  proprietary_frameworks:
    - [ ] At least one named framework unique to this creator
    - [ ] Framework based on personal experience + synthesis (not just repackaged)
    - [ ] Framework is teachable and referenceable by audience
  voice_and_style:
    - [ ] Writing/speaking style is distinctive and recognizable
    - [ ] Opinions are specific and sometimes polarizing (not generic)
    - [ ] Content couldn't be created by a generic AI without this person's perspective
    - [ ] Aesthetic and visual identity are consistent and ownable
```

---

## 3. Category of One Positioning

```yaml
category_of_one:
  positioning_statement:
    - [ ] Can complete: "I help {specific audience} achieve {specific outcome} through {unique method}"
    - [ ] Positioning doesn't use generic descriptors ("coach", "consultant", "expert")
    - [ ] Title/label is invented or redefined (Dan Koe = "the one-person business educator")
  competitive_moat:
    - [ ] Competitors can't copy the personal element (your story, your taste, your opinions)
    - [ ] Brand is attached to a person, not a company name (portable)
    - [ ] Audience follows the person, not just the content topic
  category_creation:
    - [ ] New term or concept coined that the audience associates with creator
    - [ ] Creator is THE reference point for this intersection
    - [ ] Google/social search for the intersection returns creator's content
```

---

## 4. Depth vs Breadth Balance

```yaml
depth_breadth:
  depth:
    - [ ] Core topic has enough depth for 3+ years of content
    - [ ] Creator can go deeper than surface level (demonstrates mastery)
    - [ ] Multiple sub-topics exist within the intersection
  breadth:
    - [ ] Intersection is broad enough to attract a viable audience size
    - [ ] Content can evolve without leaving the intersection
    - [ ] Adjacent topics can be explored without brand confusion
  sustainability:
    - [ ] Creator is genuinely passionate about all domains (won't burn out)
    - [ ] Learning and creating in this space is energizing, not draining
    - [ ] Market for this intersection is growing, not shrinking
```

---

## 5. Monopoly Activation

```yaml
monopoly_activation:
  content_demonstration:
    - [ ] Content consistently demonstrates the intersection (every piece)
    - [ ] Audience can describe creator's monopoly in their own words
    - [ ] New followers understand the monopoly within 3 pieces of content
  monetization_alignment:
    - [ ] Products and offers directly serve the monopoly audience
    - [ ] Pricing reflects monopoly premium (no race to bottom)
    - [ ] Revenue grows as monopoly strengthens (compounding)
  evolution_plan:
    - [ ] Monopoly can evolve as creator grows (not a cage)
    - [ ] Expansion plan into adjacent territories mapped
    - [ ] Legacy vision: what does this monopoly become in 5-10 years?
```

## Scoring

| Category | Items | Points Each | Max |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----|
| Critical — Unique Intersection | 11 | 3 | 33 |
| Critical — Non-Replicability | 11 | 3 | 33 |
| Standard — Category of One Positioning | 9 | 2 | 18 |
| Standard — Depth vs Breadth Balance | 9 | 2 | 18 |
| Bonus — Monopoly Activation | 9 | 1 | 9 |
| **TOTAL** | **49** | | **111** |

### Thresholds
- **PASS**: >= 89 points (80%)
- **CONDITIONAL**: >= 67 points (60%)
- **FAIL**: < 67 points

### If FAIL
1. Re-identify domains — if intersection is generic, dig deeper into unusual combinations from your actual experience
2. Document your origin story — if non-replicability is weak, your personal narrative needs more specificity
3. Name your framework — if category-of-one fails, you need proprietary language that only you use
4. Test with 5 target audience members: "What do you know me for?" — if answers are vague, monopoly isn't established
