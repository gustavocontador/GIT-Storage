## Domain Overview

Copywriting is the craft of writing persuasive text that drives a specific action — buying, subscribing, clicking, or engaging. It is NOT creative writing, journalism, or content marketing (though it overlaps). Direct response copywriting specifically demands measurable, trackable results.

## Key Concepts

### Market Awareness (Eugene Schwartz)
- **5 Stages**: Unaware → Problem Aware → Solution Aware → Product Aware → Most Aware
- **Why It Matters**: The awareness level dictates your ENTIRE copy strategy — headline, lead, structure, offer

### Market Sophistication (Eugene Schwartz)
- **5 Levels**: Direct Claim → Enlarged Claim → Mechanism → Expanded Mechanism → Identification
- **Why It Matters**: Determines HOW you position your offer relative to competition

### PAS Formula (Dan Kennedy)
- **Problem → Agitation → Solution**: The universal direct response structure
- **Variations**: PASTOR (Ray Edwards), AIDA (classic), PAS+O (with Offer)

### Mechanism (Stefan Georgi)
- **Definition**: The unique explanation of WHY your solution works when others don't
- **Why It Matters**: In saturated markets (Level 3+), the mechanism IS your differentiator

### Slippery Slide (Joe Sugarman)
- **Definition**: Every element of copy exists to get the reader to read the next element
- **Application**: Headlines → first line → second line → ... → CTA. No wasted words.

### A-Pile / B-Pile (Gary Halbert)
- **Definition**: All communication is mentally sorted into "personal" (opened) or "junk" (discarded)
- **Application**: Your copy must FEEL personal, not corporate/mass-produced

### VOC Mining (Joanna Wiebe)
- **Definition**: Extracting exact customer language from reviews, surveys, interviews
- **Golden Rule**: Use THEIR words, not yours. The best copy mirrors the customer's inner monologue.

## Best Practices (From Researched Minds)

1. **Research before writing** — 60-80% of copywriting time should be research (Ramit Sethi, Joanna Wiebe)
2. **Specifics over generalities** — "37% improvement" beats "significant improvement" (Caples, Hopkins)
3. **Benefits, not features** — "What's in it for ME?" is the only question (Bly, Kennedy)
4. **Test everything** — No opinions, only data (Hopkins, Caples)
5. **Long copy outsells short** — When properly written (Caples, Halbert, Sugarman)
6. **The offer matters more than the copy** — A great offer with mediocre copy beats mediocre offer with great copy (Kennedy, Brown)
7. **P.S. sections are read by 90%** — Put your strongest benefit there (Halbert)
8. **Write like you talk** — Conversational copy outperforms formal copy (Halbert, Sugarman)
9. **One idea per piece** — The Rule of One (Wiebe)
10. **The headline is worth 80 cents of every dollar** — Spend proportional effort (Ogilvy, Caples)

## Common Anti-Patterns

1. **Writing before researching** — "I already know my audience" (No, you don't until you mine VOC data)
2. **Feature dumping** — Listing features without connecting to benefits
3. **Corporate tone** — "We are pleased to announce..." (Nobody cares about your announcements)
4. **Weak CTA** — "Click here to learn more" (Learn more about WHAT? Why NOW?)
5. **No proof** — Claims without testimonials, data, or specifics
6. **Burying the lead** — The best benefit hidden in paragraph 7
7. **Clever wordplay** — Puns and creativity that sacrifice clarity
8. **No urgency** — "Buy whenever you feel like it" = never
9. **Multiple CTAs** — Offering 5 different actions confuses the reader
10. **Ignoring awareness level** — Selling to an unaware market like they're product-aware
