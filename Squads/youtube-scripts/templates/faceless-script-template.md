# Faceless Script Template

> **Purpose:** This template is specifically designed for faceless YouTube channels that rely on voiceover narration, stock footage, motion graphics, and music. Unlike face-to-camera scripts where the creator can improvise or adjust tone on the fly, faceless scripts must be HIGHLY DETAILED with production annotations to guide editors and narration artists.
>
> **How to use:** Specialists use this template when the brief indicates `Face on Camera: No (faceless)`. Every visual, every music cue, every transition must be specified. Vagueness in a faceless script leads to expensive revisions or mismatched production.

[2] SCRIPT WITH PRODUCTION ANNOTATIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  → This is the CORE of a faceless script. Every paragraph includes:
    1. [VOICE] — Tone, pace, emphasis for the narration
    2. [B-ROLL] — Specific visuals with search terms and mood
    3. [MUSIC] — Genre, BPM, energy, and transition points
    4. [GRAPHIC] — On-screen text, stats, or animations
    5. [TRANSITION] — How we move from one scene to the next

  → Format: One scene per block. A "scene" is defined by a shift in
    visuals, music, or tone. Typical 8-minute video = 12-20 scenes.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SCENE 1 — HOOK OPEN (0:00-0:15)

[VOICE: shocked, urgent, moderate pace, emphasis on "$50,000"]
I lost $50,000 in a single day — and it wasn't because of a bad
investment. It was because I ignored one simple rule that I'm about
to share with you.

[B-ROLL:
  - 0:00-0:05  →  Stock market crash montage: red charts, falling
                   numbers, panic on trading floor, high energy cuts
  - 0:05-0:10  →  Close-up of person's hands gripping head in stress,
                   dark moody lighting, shallow depth of field
  - 0:10-0:15  →  Zoom into laptop screen showing portfolio loss,
                   red "-$50,000" highlighted
  Search terms: "stock market crash," "financial stress," "portfolio loss"
  Mood: tense, high stakes, cinematic]

[MUSIC:
  Genre: Cinematic tension (strings + deep bass)
  BPM: 90
  Energy: High, building
  Transition: Fade in from silence at 0:00, crescendo at 0:10]

[GRAPHIC:
  - 0:05  →  Bold text overlay "$50,000 LOST" in red, center screen,
             2 sec duration, slight shake animation
  - 0:12  →  Subtle lower-third text: "Keep watching to find out why"]

[TRANSITION: Hard cut at 0:15 to Scene 2]

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SCENE 2 — PROMISE + HOOK (0:15-0:40)

[VOICE: shift to calm authority, slower pace, conversational tone]
If you're holding any amount of money in crypto, stocks, or even a
savings account, this 7-minute video could save you from the same
mistake. Here's what we're going to cover.

[B-ROLL:
  - 0:15-0:25  →  Wide shot of organized desk: laptop, notebook,
                   coffee, plants, warm natural lighting, static shot
  - 0:25-0:40  →  B-roll of someone typing on laptop, over-the-shoulder
                   shot, calm aesthetic, shallow focus on hands
  Search terms: "productive workspace," "financial planning desk,"
                "calm office aesthetic"
  Mood: calm, professional, inviting]

[MUSIC:
  Genre: Lo-fi chill (soft piano + light percussion)
  BPM: 70
  Energy: Low-medium, steady
  Transition: Crossfade from Scene 1 tension music at 0:15, 2 sec overlap]

[GRAPHIC:
  - 0:25  →  Animated list appears on right side of frame:
             "1. The Rule"
             "2. The 3-Step System"
             "3. How to Avoid My Mistake"
             Each item fades in sequentially, 0.5 sec apart
  - Position: Right 1/3 of screen, leave left 2/3 for B-roll]

[TRANSITION: Dissolve, 0.5 sec, into Scene 3]

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SCENE 3 — POINT 1 INTRO (0:40-1:15)

[VOICE: authoritative, moderate pace, emphasis on "78% of investors"]
First, let's talk about why 78% of investors don't know about this
rule. The financial system isn't designed to teach you this —
because if everyone knew it, Wall Street would lose billions.

[B-ROLL:
  - 0:40-0:55  →  Montage of Wall Street: trading floors, suited
                   professionals, skyscrapers, fast cuts every 3-5 sec
  - 0:55-1:15  →  Animated infographic: "78% Don't Know This Rule"
                   with icons of confused investors, clean motion design
  Search terms: "Wall Street trading floor," "financial district NYC,"
                "investor infographic"
  Mood: authoritative, corporate, high stakes]

[MUSIC:
  Genre: Same lo-fi from Scene 2, but add subtle tension layer
  BPM: 70 (maintain continuity)
  Energy: Medium, building slightly
  Transition: No change, continuous from Scene 2]

[GRAPHIC:
  - 0:50  →  Stat callout: "78%" in large bold font, center screen,
             circle highlight, 3 sec hold
  - 1:00  →  Lower-third text: "Source: Financial Industry Report 2024"
             Small font, bottom left, 5 sec duration]

[TRANSITION: Zoom transition (slight zoom into stat) at 1:15 into Scene 4]

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

{Continue for all major scenes through the full video...}

SCENE 4 — POINT 1 DEEP DIVE (1:15-2:30)

[VOICE: ...]
[B-ROLL: ...]
[MUSIC: ...]
[GRAPHIC: ...]
[TRANSITION: ...]

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SCENE 5 — PATTERN INTERRUPT (2:30-2:45)

[VOICE: sudden tone shift to conversational, almost whisper]
Now, before I reveal the rule, let me tell you the exact moment I
realized I'd made the mistake.

[B-ROLL:
  - 2:30-2:45  →  First-person POV shot: walking into a room, opening
                   a laptop, discovering bad news on screen
                   OR stock footage of person sitting alone in dim room,
                   looking at phone with shocked expression
  Search terms: "person shocked by phone," "bad news reaction,"
                "financial stress alone"
  Mood: intimate, tense, cinematic]

[MUSIC:
  Genre: All music STOPS at 2:30 (dead silence for 3 seconds)
  BPM: N/A
  Energy: Silence creates tension
  Transition: Hard stop at 2:30, new ambient drone fades in at 2:35]

[GRAPHIC: None (let the silence and visual carry the moment)]

[TRANSITION: Slow fade to black, 1 sec, then fade into Scene 6]

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

{Continue through climax, CTA, and close...}

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FINAL SCENE — CTA + CLOSE (6:30-7:00)

[VOICE: empowering, confident, warm tone, moderate pace]
If this video saved you from making the same $50,000 mistake I made,
do me a favor — hit that subscribe button. I post one video like
this every single week, and the next one could save you even more.

[B-ROLL:
  - 6:30-6:45  →  Animated subscribe button graphic (YouTube style),
                   glowing, pulsing, center screen
  - 6:45-7:00  →  Montage of previous video thumbnails from the channel,
                   quick cuts, showing variety and value
  Search terms: N/A (use channel's own assets)
  Mood: uplifting, community-focused, welcoming]

[MUSIC:
  Genre: Uplifting electronic (major key, hopeful)
  BPM: 100
  Energy: High, celebratory
  Transition: Swell at 6:30, fade out at 6:58]

[GRAPHIC:
  - 6:33  →  Animated text: "SUBSCRIBE" with arrow pointing to button

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[3] AI NARRATION NOTES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  → These notes ensure the AI voice (or human VO artist) delivers the
    script with the intended emotion, pacing, and emphasis. AI voices
    require explicit direction — they won't infer tone from context.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SENTENCE LENGTH TARGETS:

  - Average: 12-18 words per sentence
  - Max: 25 words (AI voices lose naturalness beyond this)
  - Shortest sentence in script: "Here's the mistake I made." (5 words)
  - Longest sentence in script: {identify and list if >25 words}

  → If any sentence exceeds 25 words, break it with a period, em-dash,
    or ellipsis for natural pacing.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

EMPHASIS MARKERS (words to vocally stress):

  - 0:05   →  "$50,000" (louder, slower)
  - 0:20   →  "simple rule" (emphasis on "simple")
  - 1:00   →  "78% of investors" (emphasis on percentage)
  - 2:35   →  "exact moment" (slow down, dramatic)
  - 5:30   →  "this is the rule" (clear, authoritative)
  - 6:35   →  "subscribe button" (friendly, not pushy)

  → For ElevenLabs or Descript, use <emphasis> tags or manual markup
    in the narration input.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PAUSE MARKERS (deliberate silence for effect):

  - 0:08   →  1.0 sec pause after "...in a single day"
  - 1:12   →  0.5 sec pause after "...Wall Street would lose billions"
  - 2:30   →  1.5 sec pause (silence + music stops, max tension)
  - 5:35   →  0.8 sec pause before revealing "the rule"
  - 6:15   →  0.5 sec pause after "...could save you even more"

  → In AI tools, use [pause: 1.0s] notation or insert manual breaks.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TONE SHIFTS (emotional transitions to direct):

| Timestamp | Tone Shift              | Direction                     |
|-----------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 0:00      | Shocked, urgent         | High energy, fast delivery    |
| 0:15      | Calm authority          | Slow down, steady, confident  |
| 1:00      | Authoritative           | Clear, factual, no emotion    |
| 2:30      | Intimate, confessional  | Quiet, almost whisper         |
| 3:45      | Empathetic, relatable   | Warm, conversational          |
| 5:30      | Climactic reveal        | Build intensity, then release |
| 6:30      | Empowering, uplifting   | Positive, motivational        |

  → For AI voices: adjust "Stability" and "Clarity" sliders per section.
    High stability = consistent tone. Low stability = more variation.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PRONUNCIATION GUIDE (technical terms, names, acronyms):

  - If script includes jargon or uncommon words, provide phonetic
    spelling here:
    - "Cryptocurrency" → krip-toh-KUR-en-see
    - "Portfolio" → port-FOH-lee-oh (not port-foh-LEE-oh)
    - Proper nouns, company names, etc.

## Specialist Notes: Faceless Script Best Practices

### 1. B-Roll Specificity is Everything
Vague B-roll directions like "financial visuals" lead to generic stock footage and weak retention. Instead:
- **Bad:** "Show money"
- **Good:** "Close-up of $100 bills fanning out in slow motion, warm lighting, shallow depth of field, 5 sec hold"

Include search terms the editor can copy-paste into stock sites (Artlist, Storyblocks, Pexels).

### 2. Music Sets the Emotional Tone
Faceless videos rely HEAVILY on music to carry emotion (no facial expressions to read). Map music changes to emotional beats:
- Tension music during problem/stakes
- Calm music during explanation/solution
- Uplifting music during CTA/close

Avoid abrupt music changes — use 1-2 sec crossfades unless a hard cut is intentional (like the silence in Scene 5 above).

### 3. Graphics Should Reinforce, Not Distract
Text overlays are powerful retention tools BUT:
- Don't cover critical B-roll with text
- Use lower-thirds for citations and stats
- Center-screen text only for major beats (hooks, reveals, CTAs)
- Animate graphics subtly (fade in, not flashy spins)

### 4. AI Narration Limitations
AI voices have improved massively, but they still struggle with:
- Sentences >25 words (they lose naturalness)
- Complex punctuation (em-dashes, semicolons confuse them)
- Sarcasm, irony, or subtext (they deliver it flat)

Write for AI clarity: short sentences, simple punctuation, explicit tone direction.

### 5. Shot List = Editor's Sanity
Editors often work from shot lists, not full scripts. Providing a shot list table (Section 4) speeds up production and reduces miscommunication.

### 6. Test the Script Aloud
Before delivery, READ THE SCRIPT OUT LOUD at the target WPM. Does it feel natural? Are there tongue-twisters? Do pauses feel awkward? Faceless scripts don't allow for on-the-fly adjustments — the narration is locked once recorded.
