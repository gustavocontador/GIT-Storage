success_criteria:
  - All variables extracted for all papers
  - Data in structured, analyzable format
  - Missing data documented
  - For systematic reviews: dual extraction completed

deliverables:
  - Data extraction spreadsheet (CSV/Excel)
  - Extraction form/template
  - Notes on any issues or missing data

  study_characteristics:
    - Author(s)
    - Year
    - Country
    - Study design (RCT, survey, case study, etc.)
    - Sample size (N)
    - Participant demographics (age, education level)

  methodology:
    - Data collection method (interviews, surveys, observations)
    - Analysis method (thematic analysis, regression, etc.)
    - Duration of study

  findings:
    - Main findings (key results)
    - Effect size (if quantitative)
    - Statistical significance (p-values)
    - Themes (if qualitative)

  quality:
    - Limitations reported
    - Conflicts of interest
    - Funding source

best_practices:
  - Pilot test extraction form on 3-5 papers before full extraction
  - Use dual extraction for systematic reviews (two independent extractors)
  - Create clear definitions for each variable
  - Use standardized coding schemes when possible
  - Contact authors if key data is missing
  - Document missing data (don't leave blank without notes)
  - Calculate inter-rater agreement for dual extraction

common_pitfalls:
  - Extraction form too complex (takes too long)
  - Not pilot testing (discover issues too late)
  - Single extractor only (error risk)
  - Not standardizing variable definitions
  - Losing track of which papers have been extracted
