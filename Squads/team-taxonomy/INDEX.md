## 🎯 Key Concepts at a Glance

### 4 Team Types (Matthew Skelton)
```
Stream-Aligned     → Own business value
Platform           → Enable other teams
Enabling           → Temporary, teaches others
Complicated-Sub    → Handle irreducible complexity
```

### 3 Interaction Modes (Manuel Pais)
```
Collaboration      → Sync, high-touch (time-boxed)
X-as-a-Service     → Async, stable service
Facilitation       → Coaching, temporary
```

### 5 Problem Types (Ruth Malan)
```
Structure          → Teams are wrong (needs restructure)
Interaction        → Teams are right but interact wrong
Governance         → Unclear decision authority
Tools/Process      → Infrastructure is broken
Culture            → Trust/sharing issues
```

### Orchestration Patterns (Barry Hawkins)
```
Sequential         → A → B → C (stage-gate)
Parallel           → A || B || C (concurrent)
Hierarchical       → Chief → Specialists
Peer               → A ↔ B ↔ C (negotiation)
```

## 🔗 Integration with AIOS

This squad integrates seamlessly:

1. **After Team Taxonomy designs structure**
   - → Use `squad-creator` to build agents
   - → Use `dev` squad to implement

2. **For agent squad design**
   - → Use workflows to validate
   - → Apply patterns to AIOS squad structure

3. **For organizational assessment**
   - → Use health check before major changes
   - → Route appropriately to specialists

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always start with diagnosis**
   - "Don't know what's wrong?" → ruth-malan first
   - Diagnosis drives the fix approach

2. **Try cheap fixes before expensive ones**
   - Interaction/governance fixes: 2-3 weeks
   - Restructure: 2-6 months
   - Try interaction first!

3. **Use workflows for multi-phase work**
   - Single agent for quick consultation
   - Workflows for complete transformations
   - Chief orchestrates complex scenarios

4. **Measure before and after**
   - Define success metrics upfront
   - Track improvements
   - Iterate based on results

5. **Apply Conway's Law**
   - Org structure shapes system architecture
   - Design org intentionally (don't let it evolve)
   - Mirror desired system design
