## 1. Voice Consistency Across Platforms

```yaml
voice_consistency:
  tone_alignment:
    - [ ] Core message preserved across all platform adaptations
    - [ ] Dan Koe's philosophical-yet-practical tone maintained
    - [ ] No corporate jargon injected during adaptation
    - [ ] Contrarian angle preserved (not softened for platform norms)
  identity_markers:
    - [ ] "One-person business" framing consistent
    - [ ] Self-education narrative present
    - [ ] Anti-traditional-employment stance intact
    - [ ] Personal evolution language used (not static advice)
```

---

## 2. Platform-Specific Formatting

```yaml
platform_formatting:
  twitter_x:
    - [ ] Thread hook under 280 characters with pattern interrupt
    - [ ] Each tweet is standalone valuable (not dependent on prior)
    - [ ] Thread uses 5-12 tweets (sweet spot for engagement)
    - [ ] Final tweet includes CTA or callback to first
  linkedin:
    - [ ] Opening line creates curiosity gap
    - [ ] Line breaks every 1-2 sentences for mobile readability
    - [ ] Professional framing without losing edge
  instagram:
    - [ ] Carousel slides limited to 7-10 per post
    - [ ] Text-on-image uses high contrast and large font
    - [ ] Caption opens with hook, not context
  youtube:
    - [ ] Title under 60 characters with curiosity or controversy
    - [ ] Description includes timestamps and key takeaways
    - [ ] Thumbnail text contrasts video title (complementary, not duplicate)
```

---

## 3. Engagement Optimization

```yaml
engagement_optimization:
  hook_quality:
    - [ ] First line/sentence creates "I need to know more" reaction
    - [ ] Hook addresses a pain point or challenges a belief
    - [ ] No generic openings ("In this post I will...")
  interaction_triggers:
    - [ ] At least one question posed to audience per piece
    - [ ] Controversial or polarizing take included (attracts comments)
    - [ ] Content ends with open loop or CTA
  shareability:
    - [ ] Contains at least one quotable/screenshottable line
    - [ ] Frameworks or models are visually structured
    - [ ] Content solves a problem the reader's audience also has
```

---

## 4. Matrix Completeness

```yaml
matrix_completeness:
  source_coverage:
    - [ ] Original content piece identified and linked
    - [ ] All target platforms in matrix have adaptations
    - [ ] No platform skipped without documented reason
  adaptation_depth:
    - [ ] Each adaptation is native (not just copy-paste with minor edits)
    - [ ] Platform-specific features leveraged (polls, carousels, threads)
    - [ ] Adaptation adds platform-native value (not just reformats)
```

---

## 5. Quality Gates

```yaml
quality_gates:
  non_negotiables:
    - [ ] Zero spelling/grammar errors in final output
    - [ ] All links functional and pointing to correct destinations
    - [ ] No broken formatting (missing line breaks, orphaned bullets)
  brand_safety:
    - [ ] No content that contradicts Dan Koe's published positions
    - [ ] No engagement bait that sacrifices brand trust
    - [ ] Competitor mentions handled tastefully (if at all)
```
