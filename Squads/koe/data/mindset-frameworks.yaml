frameworks:

  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # FRAMEWORK 1: Conscious Conditioning Process
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  - id: MF-001
    name: "Conscious Conditioning Process"
    category: "identity_transformation"
    description: "Systematic five-step process for rewiring automatic negative responses into conscious empowering choices through deliberate practice and neurological reinforcement"
    steps:
      - step: 1
        name: "Recognize"
        action: "Catch the automatic thought, emotion, or behavioral pattern without judgment"
        key_skill: "Metacognition — observing your own thinking as if watching a movie"
        practice: "Daily meditation (10 min), evening journaling, pause-before-react discipline"
        pitfall: "Judging the thought instead of simply observing it"

      - step: 2
        name: "Reframe"
        action: "Question the belief underlying the automatic response and find empowering alternatives"
        key_questions:
          - "Is this actually true, or is it a story I'm telling myself?"
          - "What else could be true about this situation?"
          - "What would my future self think about this?"
          - "How can this experience serve me instead of limiting me?"
        pitfall: "Forced toxic positivity instead of genuine reframing"

      - step: 3
        name: "Design Response"
        action: "Consciously choose the empowering interpretation and corresponding action"
        principle: "You cannot control events. You CAN control your response to events."
        technique: "Write down the old response and the new designed response side by side"
        pitfall: "Designing an unsustainable response — start small and build"

      - step: 4
        name: "Repeat"
        action: "Practice the new response consistently until it becomes automatic"
        science: "Neural pathways strengthen through repetition (myelination) — each rep makes the new response faster and more natural"
        minimum: "21 days for initial habit formation, 66 days for automaticity"
        pitfall: "Expecting overnight transformation — conditioning is a practice, not a pill"

      - step: 5
        name: "Reward"
        action: "Celebrate the new response to reinforce the neural pathway"
        types:
          - "Intrinsic: pride and satisfaction in choosing the empowering response"
          - "Social: sharing wins with an accountability partner or community"
          - "Tangible: small reward after consistent streak (7 days, 30 days)"
        pitfall: "Skipping rewards — the brain needs positive reinforcement to lock in new pathways"

    when_to_use:
      - "Emotional reactivity (anger, frustration, fear) disrupting productivity"
      - "Recurring negative thought patterns about capability or worthiness"
      - "Self-sabotage behaviors that persist despite wanting to change"
      - "Any situation where your default response isn't serving your goals"
    source: "Dan Koe — The Art of Focus, Modern Mastery course, Newsletter articles"
    related_frameworks: ["MF-004", "MF-005"]
    example:
      situation: "Creator freezes when about to publish content, fearing criticism"
      recognize: "Notice the thought: 'People will judge me. This isn't good enough.'"
      reframe: "'Good enough' is a moving target. Published is better than perfect. Criticism means people are paying attention."
      design_response: "Set a timer for 5 minutes. At zero, hit publish regardless. Then close the app for 2 hours."
      repeat: "Do this for every piece of content for 30 days. Track completions."
      reward: "After 30 consecutive publishes, buy that book you've been wanting."

  # FRAMEWORK 2: Polarity Principle
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  - id: MF-002
    name: "Polarity Principle"
    category: "motivation_design"
    description: "Dual-force motivation system using the tension between Vision (what you move toward) and Anti-Vision (what you move away from) to create sustained, energized action"
    components:
      vision:
        definition: "The vivid, specific image of your ideal future self and life"
        characteristics:
          - "Specific enough to feel real (not vague aspirations)"
          - "Identity-based ('I am someone who...') not just goal-based"
          - "Emotionally charged — must create genuine pull"
          - "10-year horizon for strategic clarity"
        danger: "Too much vision without urgency = complacency, daydreaming, procrastination"
        practice: "Monthly vision journaling — describe your ideal Tuesday in detail"

      anti_vision:
        definition: "The visceral, concrete picture of the life you refuse to live"
        characteristics:
          - "Present-tense pain — feel it NOW, not abstractly"
          - "Specific enough to be uncomfortable (the cubicle, the boss, the regret)"
          - "Productively uncomfortable — motivating, not paralyzing"
          - "Connected to your current trajectory if nothing changes"
        danger: "Too much anti-vision without hope = burnout, cynicism, depression"
        practice: "Quarterly anti-vision writing — describe what life looks like in 5 years if you change nothing"

    tension_mechanism: "The gap between Vision and Anti-Vision creates PRODUCTIVE TENSION — the energy that drives action"
    balance_rule: "If you lack urgency, your anti-vision is too weak. If you're burning out, your vision is unclear."

    when_to_use:
      - "Motivation dips or creative blocks"
      - "Major strategic decisions (evaluate against both poles)"
      - "Annual/quarterly planning and goal-setting"
      - "When comfort is becoming complacency"
    source: "Dan Koe — The Art of Focus, Newsletter (Polarity Principle article)"
    related_frameworks: ["MF-001", "MF-005"]
    example:
      vision: "In 5 years: Working 4 hours/day on ideas I'm passionate about, $500K annual revenue from digital products, writing from a cafe in Lisbon, community of 100K+ subscribers who value my perspective."
      anti_vision: "In 5 years if nothing changes: Still working 50 hours/week for clients, no IP owned, income dependent on next project, scrolling social media instead of creating, regretting not starting when I had the energy."
      tension: "The gap between these two images creates the urgency to start today AND the clarity of what to build."

  # FRAMEWORK 3: Autoprogramming Protocol
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  - id: MF-003
    name: "Autoprogramming Protocol"
    category: "belief_engineering"
    description: "Systematic process for identifying, replacing, and installing empowering beliefs through deliberate practice — NOT affirmations, but beliefs coupled with action"
    key_distinction: "Affirmations are words without action. Autoprogramming combines belief with behavior. You don't just SAY 'I am confident' — you DO confident things until the belief catches up."
    steps:
      - step: 1
        name: "Audit"
        action: "List current beliefs about money, success, capability, worthiness, and creativity"
        technique: "Complete these sentences honestly: 'Money is...', 'I am...', 'Success requires...', 'I deserve...'"
        output: "Raw belief inventory — don't filter or judge"

      - step: 2
        name: "Evaluate"
        action: "Score each belief: does it serve your Vision or your Anti-Vision?"
        scoring:
          serves_vision: "+1 (keep and strengthen)"
          neutral: "0 (investigate further)"
          serves_anti_vision: "-1 (replace immediately)"
        output: "Categorized belief map"

      - step: 3
        name: "Replace"
        action: "Write the empowering version of each limiting belief"
        rules:
          - "Must be believable (not delusional) — stretch, don't snap"
          - "Must be actionable (what behavior does this belief produce?)"
          - "Must be specific (not 'I am successful' but 'I create valuable content that helps people')"
        output: "Replacement belief set"

      - step: 4
        name: "Install"
        action: "Practice the new belief through journaling, self-talk, AND corresponding action"
        methods:
          - "Morning journaling: write the new belief and one action it demands today"
          - "Self-talk correction: when old belief surfaces, consciously redirect to new"
          - "Behavioral proof: take actions that PROVE the new belief true"
        output: "Daily practice log"

      - step: 5
        name: "Verify"
        action: "After 30 days, assess if the new belief feels natural"
        test: "Does this belief arise automatically in relevant situations? If not, more reps needed."
        output: "Belief installation status (installed/in-progress/needs-more-reps)"

    when_to_use:
      - "Deep-seated limiting beliefs about money, creativity, or capability"
      - "Identity shifts (employee to entrepreneur, consumer to creator)"
      - "Persistent self-sabotage despite knowing what to do"
      - "After Conscious Conditioning reveals root belief behind behavior"
    source: "Dan Koe — Modern Mastery course, Newsletter articles on identity"
    related_frameworks: ["MF-001", "MF-002"]
    example:
      old_belief: "'I'm not an expert. Who would pay for my knowledge?'"
      evaluation: "-1 (serves anti-vision — keeps you small and dependent)"
      new_belief: "'I have unique lived experience that helps people. My specific knowledge is valuable because nobody else has my intersection of skills and stories.'"
      installation: "Publish 1 piece of content per day sharing what I know. Track positive responses. After 30 days, review evidence."

  # FRAMEWORK 4: Habit Loop Reengineering
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  - id: MF-004
    name: "Habit Loop Reengineering"
    category: "behavior_design"
    description: "Redesign the Cue-Routine-Reward loop to replace destructive habits with empowering ones through environment design and identity attachment"
    components:
      cue:
        definition: "The trigger that initiates the habit loop"
        design_principles:
          - "Make desired behavior cue OBVIOUS (put journal on pillow, open writing app first)"
          - "Make undesired behavior cue INVISIBLE (delete social media apps, block sites)"
          - "Use existing habits as cues for new ones (habit stacking)"
        examples:
          - "Alarm at 6am → Sit at desk (not check phone)"
          - "Coffee brewed → Open writing document"
          - "Lunch finished → 15-min walk (not scroll)"

      routine:
        definition: "The behavior itself — the action performed"
        design_principles:
          - "Start absurdly small (2 minutes, not 2 hours)"
          - "Make it easy — reduce friction to near zero"
          - "Identity-based ('I am a writer' not 'I should write')"
          - "Scale gradually after the habit is established"
        examples:
          - "Write 1 sentence (not 1000 words) — just start"
          - "Do 1 pushup (not 50) — just begin"
          - "Capture 1 idea (not process 10) — just notice"

      reward:
        definition: "The positive reinforcement that locks in the habit"
        design_principles:
          - "Immediate reward (not delayed gratification for habit formation)"
          - "Identity confirmation ('I showed up, I am a creator')"
          - "Visual tracking (streak counter, calendar X marks)"
          - "Never break the chain — 2 misses in a row resets the loop"
        examples:
          - "After writing: checkmark on calendar + 5 minutes of enjoyable activity"
          - "After deep work block: coffee break + review what you created"
          - "After publishing: close laptop and walk — reward the ship, not the result"

    myelination_layer: "Every repetition strengthens the neural pathway. The 100th rep is exponentially easier than the 1st. This is neurological compound interest."

    when_to_use:
      - "Building new creative habits (writing, creating, publishing)"
      - "Breaking destructive habits (social media addiction, procrastination)"
      - "Redesigning daily routines for deep work optimization"
      - "Supporting Conscious Conditioning with behavioral reinforcement"
    source: "Dan Koe — The Art of Focus, adapted from Charles Duhigg and James Clear with Koe's identity-first approach"
    related_frameworks: ["MF-001", "MF-003"]
    example:
      target_habit: "Daily deep writing for content creation"
      cue_design: "Coffee machine finishes brewing → sit at desk with document open (no phone in room)"
      routine_design: "Write for 2 minutes minimum. If flow state emerges, continue up to 90 minutes."
      reward_design: "After session: mark calendar X, review word count, enjoy 10 minutes of guilt-free leisure."
      identity_attachment: "'I am a professional writer. Writers write daily. This is who I am.'"

  # FRAMEWORK 5: Anti-Conformity Principle
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  - id: MF-005
    name: "Anti-Conformity Principle"
    category: "strategic_thinking"
    description: "Systematic questioning of default paths, conventional wisdom, and societal expectations — not contrarianism for its own sake, but informed divergence based on first-principles thinking"
    components:
      - name: "Question Default Paths"
        description: "Before following any conventional path, ask: 'Is this actually optimal, or is it just common?'"
        examples:
          - "College → Corporate job → Retirement (is this the only path to financial security?)"
          - "Niche down → Specialize → Compete (is hyper-specialization really necessary?)"
          - "Hustle harder → Work more hours → Grind (does more effort = more results?)"

      - name: "First-Principles Audit"
        description: "Strip advice back to its fundamental assumptions and test each one"
        process:
          - "1. Identify the conventional advice"
          - "2. List the assumptions it's based on"
          - "3. Test each assumption against your specific situation"
          - "4. Keep what's true, discard what's just common"

      - name: "Informed Divergence"
        description: "Diverge from convention ONLY when first-principles analysis supports it"
        rules:
          - "This is NOT contrarianism — you need evidence, not just rebellion"
          - "Understand WHY the convention exists before rejecting it"
          - "Test your divergent path with small experiments before committing"
          - "Be prepared to return to convention if evidence disproves your thesis"

      - name: "Productive Rebellion"
        description: "Channel anti-conformity into creation, not destruction"
        principle: "Don't just reject the default — build something better"
        examples:
          - "Reject 'niche down' → Build 'You Are The Niche' (personal monopoly)"
          - "Reject 'hustle culture' → Build 'Leverage Stack' (work less, impact more)"
          - "Reject 'find your passion' → Build 'Passion is output of mastery' (do, then love)"

    when_to_use:
      - "Before making major life/career decisions on autopilot"
      - "When 'best practices' feel wrong for your specific situation"
      - "When you notice everyone doing the same thing (saturation signal)"
      - "During strategic planning — challenge every assumption"
    source: "Dan Koe — Newsletter articles, The Art of Focus, Digital Renaissance philosophy"
    related_frameworks: ["MF-002", "MF-003"]
    example:
      convention: "'You need to niche down to succeed as a content creator.'"
      assumption_1: "Niching = specificity = easier to find audience"
      test_1: "True in 2015. In 2026, niches are oversaturated. Unique intersections win."
      assumption_2: "Being a generalist means being mediocre at everything"
      test_2: "False. T-shaped knowledge (broad + 1 deep) creates unique perspectives."
      divergent_path: "Instead of niching to 'productivity tips for developers,' combine development + philosophy + writing into a unique personal brand."
      result: "Category of one, no direct competition, higher authority."

  # FRAMEWORK 6: Focus Funnel
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  - id: MF-006
    name: "Focus Funnel"
    category: "attention_management"
    description: "Four-stage filter that every activity must pass through to earn your attention — Eliminate, Automate, Delegate, Focus. What survives the funnel is your real work."
    stages:
      - stage: 1
        name: "Eliminate"
        action: "Remove activities that produce zero or negative value — if it doesnt need to exist, kill it"
        question: "Does this NEED to exist at all?"
        examples: ["Unnecessary meetings", "Vanity metrics tracking", "Comparison scrolling", "Busywork that feels productive but creates nothing"]
        pitfall: "Keeping things because they always existed — tradition is not justification"

      - stage: 2
        name: "Automate"
        action: "Use systems, tools, and technology for anything repetitive"
        question: "Can a system do this without me?"
        examples: ["Email sequences", "Social media scheduling", "Invoice generation", "Content distribution"]
        pitfall: "Over-engineering automation for tasks that should be eliminated instead"

      - stage: 3
        name: "Delegate"
        action: "Hand off tasks that require a human but not YOUR unique skills"
        question: "Does this require MY specific genius?"
        examples: ["Editing", "Customer support", "Administrative tasks", "Research compilation"]
        pitfall: "Delegating creative vision or strategic decisions — those stay with you"

      - stage: 4
        name: "Focus"
        action: "Protect deep work time for the activities only you can do — this is your highest leverage"
        question: "Is this where my unique genius creates the MOST value?"
        examples: ["Writing original content", "Framework design", "Strategic thinking", "High-ticket calls"]
        pitfall: "Letting urgency override importance — your focus time is sacred"

    funnel_rule: "Every activity must pass through all 4 stages in order. What survives is your real work. Everything else is noise disguised as productivity."

    when_to_use:
      - "Feeling overwhelmed or spread too thin"
      - "Calendar is full but output is low"
      - "Cant find time for deep creative work"
      - "Starting a new phase and need to restructure time"
    source: "Dan Koe — The Art of Focus"
    related_frameworks: ["MF-001", "MF-005", "MF-007"]
    example:
      situation: "Creator spends 6 hours daily on social media, email, and content editing"
      eliminate: "Unsubscribe from 80% of newsletters, disable non-essential notifications, stop tracking follower count daily"
      automate: "Schedule social posts via tool, set up email templates for common responses"
      delegate: "Hire editor for videos, use VA for email triage"
      focus: "Reclaimed 3.5 hours for writing and strategic thinking — the only work that compounds"

        spectrum: "How much time consuming others' content vs creating your own?"
        healthy_ratio: "20% consume / 80% create"
        diagnostic:
          healthy: "Consuming intentionally for input, creating prolifically for output"
          warning: "Consuming > 30% — attention leaking to others' agendas"
          critical: "Consuming > 50% — you are building someone else's brand, not yours"

        rules:
          - "Accept lower output — fighting biology is a losing strategy"
          - "Use for maintenance tasks and shallow work"

        - type: "Micro Recovery (within blocks)"
          duration: "5-15 min"

    example:
      before:
        schedule: "Check email at 7am, meetings 9-11, write 2-4pm, admin 4-6pm"
        problem: "Writing happens at low energy. Peak energy wasted on email and meetings."
      after:
        schedule: "Write 6-10am (peak), Calls + editing 10am-1pm (sustained), Email + social 3-5pm (low)"
        result: "Same hours, 3x writing output, better quality, less fatigue"
