  description: >-
    AI-powered prioritization toolkit with 23 documented techniques and
    3 specialized agents across Tier 0/1/2. Diagnoses context, selects the
    optimal method, executes structured scoring sessions, and compares
    techniques — from a 5-minute Eisenhower matrix to full AHP analysis.
