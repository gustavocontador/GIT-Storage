success_criteria:
  - Ethics approval obtained before data collection
  - Comprehensive literature review completed
  - Rigorous methodology and analysis
  - High-quality manuscript written
  - Internal peer review conducted
  - Manuscript submitted to journal
  - Accepted for publication (eventually)

deliverables:
  - Research design document
  - Ethics approval certificate
  - Complete dataset
  - Literature review document
  - Analysis outputs
  - Complete manuscript
  - Peer review reports
  - Published paper

best_practices:
  - Pre-register study protocol before data collection
  - Conduct literature review early (parallel with data collection)
  - Get internal peer review before submission
  - Choose appropriate journal (fit, impact factor, acceptance rate)
  - Respond professionally to reviewer comments
  - Be patient (publication process takes time)

common_pitfalls:
  - Starting data collection before ethics approval
  - Weak literature review (missing key papers)
  - Methodological flaws discovered too late
  - Poor writing quality slowing publication
  - Submitting to wrong journal (desk rejection)
  - Defensive responses to reviewers
