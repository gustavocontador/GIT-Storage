| **Name**       | Faceless Script Checklist                  |
| **Version**    | 1.0                                        |
| **Purpose**    | Focused validation for faceless/voiceover channel scripts. Covers production annotations, B-roll density, AI narration optimization, pacing, first 45s combat, music transitions, text overlays, niche targeting, cost-effective production, and AI authenticity. |
| **When to Use** | During faceless script creation, before handing off to production, or as final quality audit. |
| **Pass Criteria** | All Critical items checked, production-readiness score 8+/10. |

---

## How to Use This Checklist

1. Have the full script ready with all production annotations embedded.
2. Work through each section sequentially, verifying production readiness.
3. Test script with AI narration tool if using TTS.
4. Calculate the production-readiness score at the end.
5. Any failed Critical item requires immediate revision before production.

## 1. PRODUCTION ANNOTATIONS COMPLETE

### Annotation Type Inventory

Count each annotation type in the script:

| Annotation Type | Count | Example from Script |
|-----------------|-------|---------------------|
| **VOICE** (tone/emphasis/pace instructions) | ___ | "___" |
| **B-ROLL** (visual footage descriptions) | ___ | "___" |
| **MUSIC** (track changes, volume adjustments) | ___ | "___" |
| **GRAPHIC** (text overlays, animations, charts) | ___ | "___" |
| **TRANSITION** (cuts, fades, effects) | ___ | "___" |

### Validation

- [ ] **(Critical)** All 5 annotation types are present in the script.
- [ ] **(Critical)** Every major section has at least one annotation of each type.
- [ ] **(Critical)** B-ROLL annotations are specific enough for sourcing (not vague like "show relevant footage").
- [ ] **(Warning)** VOICE annotations guide emotion/pacing (not just "read normally").
- [ ] **(Warning)** GRAPHIC annotations specify exact text to display (not just "add graphic here").
- [ ] **(Warning)** MUSIC annotations align with emotional beats (not generic "background music").
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Annotations are production-ready — editor could execute without asking questions.

**Annotation completeness score (1-10):** ___
