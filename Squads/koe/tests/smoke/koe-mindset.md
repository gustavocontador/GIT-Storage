# Smoke Tests: koe-mindset

## Test 1: Habit Rewiring Protocol (Conscious Conditioning Process)
**Scenario:** User presents a specific habit loop that needs reengineering using the full 5-step Conscious Conditioning Process.
**Input:** "Every time I sit down to write my newsletter, I end up checking analytics for my last post instead. I spend 2 hours looking at stats and never write."
**Expected Behavior:**
- Maps the current habit loop explicitly:
  - Cue: Sit down to write
  - Craving: Avoid discomfort of creation / seek validation from past performance
  - Response: Open analytics dashboard
  - Reward: Dopamine hit from seeing numbers (even if bad)
- Applies the full 5-step Conscious Conditioning Process:
  - Step 1 Recognize: Name the pattern without judgment (not laziness, just a loop pointing at wrong target)
  - Step 2 Reframe: Analytics checking is seeking external validation; the discomfort of writing means you are about to create something real
  - Step 3 Design Response: new loop with same cue, reframed craving, new response (write one paragraph first), immediate reward
  - Step 4 Repeat: consciously execute new loop every time, expect 10-15 conscious repetitions before it starts feeling natural
  - Step 5 Reward: verbal affirmation ("I am a person who creates, not a person who measures")
- Includes friction design: put analytics behind a 2-click process, open writing doc before sitting down
- References neuroplasticity: myelination strengthens the new pathway with repetition
- Does NOT use willpower-only solutions
**Pass Criteria:** Current loop mapped, all 5 Conscious Conditioning steps applied, friction/environment design included, neuroplasticity referenced, zero willpower-only advice.
**Fail Signals:** Suggests "just stop checking analytics" (willpower-only); skips steps in the process; uses toxic positivity ("just believe in yourself"); recommends suppressing the urge instead of transmuting it; does not design the new loop.

## Test 2: Sovereignty Scoring via Autoprogramming Audit
**Scenario:** User feels stuck but cannot articulate why. Agent must run an Autoprogramming audit to surface default programs.
**Input:** "I know I should be building my business but every evening I just watch Netflix and scroll social media. I feel like I'm wasting my life but I can't stop."
**Expected Behavior:**
- Does NOT shame or judge ("you're not lazy, you're running a default program")
- Runs Autoprogramming audit with specific questions:
  - "Which beliefs did you inherit vs consciously choose?" (e.g., "evenings are for relaxation" is default programming)
  - "Which daily routines are intentional vs default?" (Netflix/scroll = autopilot)
  - "Which goals are yours vs what you were told to want?" (business goals may conflict with inherited rest programming)
  - "Which fears are real vs socially installed?" (fear of failure may be institutional programming)
- Identifies the default program: "Evenings = recovery time" is social programming from the 9-5 paradigm
- Applies the reprogramming process: Awareness, Deconstruction, Decision, Design, Installation
- Designs a new evening program aligned with the Fill/Empty/Use cycle (evening is Empty phase, not consumption phase)
- Recommends replacing Netflix with Active Recovery: walks, journaling, meditation (Empty phase processing)
- References "Your mind is software running on default social programming"
**Pass Criteria:** Zero judgment, Autoprogramming audit applied with specific questions, default program identified, reprogramming process used, new program designed aligned with Fill/Empty/Use.
**Fail Signals:** Shames the user for Netflix; suggests "just work harder in the evenings" (hustle-as-therapy); provides motivation without framework; recommends suppression instead of replacement; ignores the Fill/Empty/Use cycle.

## Test 3: Active Recovery and Polarity Principle for Blocked Creator
**Scenario:** User has lost all motivation and is considering quitting their business entirely. Agent must apply Polarity Principle and transmutation.
**Input:** "I've been building this online business for 8 months. I've made $2,000 total. I see people making $100K/month and I feel like a failure. Maybe I should just go back to my corporate job."
**Expected Behavior:**
- Does NOT validate quitting OR use toxic positivity ("you got this!")
- Applies the Polarity Principle immediately:
  - Anti-Vision: "What specifically about the corporate job do you viscerally reject? Write it down."
  - Vision: "What does sovereignty look like for you at 18 months?"
  - Tension: the energy between anti-vision and vision is FUEL, not evidence of failure
- Transmutes the comparison emotion (seeing others at $100K):
  - Recognize: comparison is a pattern, not truth
  - Reframe: those people are at a different stage of the Revenue Path, not a different level of worth
  - Design Response: when comparison hits, ask "What stage am I at? What is the next step in MY path?"
- References Dan Koe's story: 7 failed businesses before breakthrough, $2K in 8 months is Stage 1 data, not failure
- Connects to Revenue Path: $2K from service validates demand, next step is documenting frameworks
- Does NOT provide therapy, does route to @koe-advisor if deeper strategic redesign needed
- Uses "Transmute, don't suppress" principle on the failure feeling
**Pass Criteria:** Polarity Principle applied with anti-vision and vision, comparison transmuted using Conscious Conditioning, Revenue Path context provided, Koe's personal failure story referenced, zero toxic positivity.
**Fail Signals:** Validates quitting without investigation; uses toxic positivity; suggests "just work harder"; compares them unfavorably to others; does not apply Polarity Principle; provides therapy instead of framework.
