Example:
Backend (8) | Frontend (6) | Data (4) | DevOps (2) | Product (2)
```

---

## 2. Reported Problems

| # | Problem | Reported By | Duration | Severity |
|---|---------|------------|----------|----------|
| 1 | {problem} | {source} | {how_long} | {H/M/L} |
| 2 | {problem} | {source} | {how_long} | {H/M/L} |

---

## 3. Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys)

### Problem 1: "{problem_statement}"

```
Why? → {level_1}
  Why? → {level_2}
    Why? → {level_3}
      Why? → {level_4}
        ROOT CAUSE: {root_cause}
```

### Problem 2: "{problem_statement}"

```
Why? → {level_1}
  Why? → {level_2}
    Why? → {level_3}
      ROOT CAUSE: {root_cause}
```

---

## 4. Problem Classification

```yaml
classification:
  primary:
    type: "{STRUCTURE|INTERACTION|GOVERNANCE|TOOLS|CULTURE}"
    weight: "{percentage}%"
    evidence:
      - "{evidence_1}"
      - "{evidence_2}"
      - "{evidence_3}"

  secondary:
    type: "{type}"
    weight: "{percentage}%"
    evidence:
      - "{evidence_1}"
      - "{evidence_2}"

  tertiary:
    type: "{type}"
    weight: "{percentage}%"
    evidence:
      - "{evidence_1}"
```

## 5. Current vs Ideal Comparison

| Dimension | Current State | Ideal State | Gap |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|-----|
| Team structure | {current} | {ideal} | {gap} |
| Interactions | {current} | {ideal} | {gap} |
| Decision authority | {current} | {ideal} | {gap} |
| Communication | {current} | {ideal} | {gap} |

## 6. Fix Priority Roadmap

| Priority | Fix | Type | Cost | Impact | Timeline |
|----------|-----|------|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | {fix} | {type} | {L/M/H} | {L/M/H} | {time} |
| 2 | {fix} | {type} | {L/M/H} | {L/M/H} | {time} |
| 3 | {fix} | {type} | {L/M/H} | {L/M/H} | {time} |

**Principle:** Try cheap fixes before expensive ones.

## 7. Routing Decision

```yaml
routing:
  if_structure_problem:
    route_to: "@matthew-skelton"
    task: "analyze-team-structure"

  if_interaction_problem:
    route_to: "@manuel-pais"
    task: "redesign-team-interactions"

  if_mixed:
    route_to: "both (prioritized)"
    sequence: "{sequence}"

  recommended_path: "{path}"
```
