# *viral-strategy - Viral Content Strategy

Creates a strategic approach to viral content based on outlier analysis, hook engineering, and packaging optimization. Not random — engineered.

## Why This Matters

Viral is not luck. It's pattern recognition + packaging mastery + timing. MrBeast didn't "go viral" — he studied what works, tested obsessively, and engineered virality systematically. This task gives you the same methodology adapted for faceless channels.

## Flow

```
1. Assess viral readiness
   ├── Channel stage (new channels should focus on search first)
   ├── Current CTR and retention baselines
   ├── Niche virality potential (some niches go viral easier)
   └── Time and resource availability for hero content

2. Outlier Analysis
   ├── Identify 10 competitor channels
   ├── Find their top 10 videos (by views)
   ├── Calculate outlier threshold (3x+ channel average)
   ├── Document: topic, title, thumbnail, hook, length
   ├── Find cross-channel patterns
   └── Identify psychological triggers

3. Hook Engineering
   ├── Curiosity Gap hooks: "I [did X]... here's what happened"
   ├── Contrast hooks: "$1 vs $10,000 [topic]"
   ├── Challenge hooks: "Can I [impossible-sounding thing]?"
   ├── Pain hooks: "[Specific pain point] — here's the fix"
   ├── Identity hooks: "Why [audience type] always [problem]"
   ├── Controversy hooks: "[Popular belief] is WRONG"
   ├── FOMO hooks: "Before [platform] changes this..."
   └── Create 10+ hooks customized for niche

4. Packaging Strategy (Title + Thumbnail)
   ├── Title formulas that drive CTR:
   │   ├── Number + Curiosity: "7 [things] That [surprising result]"
   │   ├── Comparison: "[A] vs [B] — Which Actually Works?"
   │   ├── Mistake format: "Stop [common action] (Do THIS Instead)"
   │   ├── Story format: "I Tried [X] for [Time] — Results"
   │   └── Authority format: "[Expert] Reveals [Secret Insight]"
   ├── Thumbnail principles for faceless channels:
   │   ├── Object/graphic-based (no face needed)
   │   ├── Before/after comparisons
   │   ├── Text overlay (3 words max)
   │   ├── High contrast, bright colors
   │   └── Emotion through visual metaphor (not facial expression)
   └── Create 5 title/thumbnail combinations for hero concepts

5. Hero Content Concepts
   ├── Concept 1: The big comparison video
   ├── Concept 2: The "everything you need to know" definitive guide
   ├── Concept 3: The challenge/experiment video
   ├── Concept 4: The contrarian take on popular belief
   ├── Concept 5: The trending topic deep dive
   └── Each with: title, thumbnail concept, hook, estimated length

6. Viral Shorts Strategy
   ├── Standalone viral Short concepts
   ├── Repurpose strategy from long-form
   ├── Hook optimization for swipe format
   ├── Series concepts that build anticipation
   └── Cross-promotion: Short → Long-form funnel

7. Distribution Strategy
   ├── Publish timing (when audience is online)
   ├── Community tab teaser before publish
   ├── Social media cross-posting plan
   ├── Email notification to list (if applicable)
   └── Engagement seeding (first comments)

8. Package strategy
```

## Elicitation Questions

```
? What's your risk tolerance for hero content?
  > Conservative (proven topics, safe angles)
    Moderate (tested formulas, some experimentation)
    Aggressive (big swings, higher risk/reward)

? What type of viral content resonates in your niche?
  > Educational (how-to, tutorials)
    Entertainment (challenges, experiments)
    Commentary (opinions, reactions)
    Story-driven (case studies, journeys)
    Data/research (stats, analysis)

? How much time can you invest in one hero video?
  > 2-4 hours (efficient production)
    4-8 hours (moderate effort)
    8+ hours (maximum quality)
```
