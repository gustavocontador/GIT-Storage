# Risk management
risks:
  execution:
    - risk: "MVP takes longer than 2 weeks"
      probability: "Medium"
      mitigation: "Cut features ruthlessly, focus on core value"

    - risk: "No users interested in MVP"
      probability: "Medium"
      mitigation: "Pivot to Opportunity #2-3"

    - risk: "Churn high, retention poor"
      probability: "Medium"
      mitigation: "User research sprint, major product pivot"

    - risk: "Economics don't support sustainable unit"
      probability: "Low"
      mitigation: "Raise prices, change business model, pivot"

  external:
    - risk: "Market changes during execution"
      probability: "Low"
      mitigation: "Stay informed, pivot if needed"

    - risk: "Competitor emerges"
      probability: "Low"
      mitigation: "Focus on unique AI advantage"
