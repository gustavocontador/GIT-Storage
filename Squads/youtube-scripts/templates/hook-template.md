## The Two Formula Hooks

These are structured, reliable hooks best suited for educational, tutorial, and value-driven content.

---

### PVSS Hook (Proof - Value - Structure - Stakes)

**When to use:** When you have credibility to leverage (results, credentials, experience). Best for finance, business, education, and tech niches.

**Template:**

```
[PROOF]:
After [specific credential, result, or experience]...

[VALUE]:
I discovered [specific value proposition — what the viewer will gain]...

[STRUCTURE]:
In this video, I'll show you [X steps / a framework / the exact method]
to [specific outcome]...

[STAKES]:
And if you miss [specific thing they'll miss], [concrete consequence]...
```

**Example (Finance niche):**

```
After managing $2.3 million in client portfolios for 8 years,
I discovered the one investment mistake that silently drains
90% of beginners' returns. In this video, I'll show you the
3-step audit I run on every portfolio — and if you skip step 2,
you could be losing $400 a month without even knowing it.
```

**Breakdown:**
- PROOF establishes authority in the first breath
- VALUE tells them exactly what's in it for them
- STRUCTURE sets expectations (they know the format)
- STAKES creates urgency (cost of not watching)

---

### TTS Hook (Target - Transformation - Stakes)

**When to use:** When speaking directly to a specific audience segment. Best for motivation, lifestyle, health/fitness, and personal development niches.

**Template:**

```
[TARGET]:
If you're a [specific audience descriptor] who [specific situation
or struggle they're in right now]...

[TRANSFORMATION]:
...this video will show you how to [specific measurable outcome]
in [timeframe, if applicable]...

[STAKES]:
...because without this, [specific risk, loss, or missed opportunity]...
```

**Example (Health/Fitness niche):**

```
If you're someone who's been going to the gym for 6 months but
still can't see your abs, this video will show you the 3 nutrition
tweaks that finally made mine visible in 8 weeks — because without
these, you're basically doing cardio for nothing.
```

**Breakdown:**
- TARGET makes the right viewer feel "this is for ME"
- TRANSFORMATION paints a vivid before/after
- STAKES makes ignoring the video feel risky

---

## The Five Cold Open Hooks

Cold opens drop the viewer into the middle of action, emotion, or intrigue. They sacrifice structure for raw attention. Best for story-driven, documentary, true crime, and commentary content.

---

### 1. Flash-Forward

**When to use:** When the video has a dramatic conclusion or transformation. You show the ending first, then rewind.

**Template:**

```
[TIME ANCHOR]: [X time ago / X months later / That morning]...
[DRAMATIC REVEAL]: I had no idea that [dramatic thing that happened]...
[CUT INSTRUCTION]: [Cut to the action / the result / the moment]...
[REWIND]: But to understand how we got here, we need to go back to
[starting point]...
```

**Example (True Crime niche):**

```
Three weeks ago, a package arrived at a home in suburban Ohio.
Inside was a handwritten letter — and the DNA of a man who'd been
missing for 14 years. [Cut to evidence photo.] But to understand
how that letter ended up there, we need to go back to a cold
November night in 2011...
```

---

### 2. Provocative Statement

**When to use:** When you want to challenge a widely held belief or create instant controversy. Works in every niche but especially commentary and education.

**Template:**

```
[PROVOCATION]: Everything you know about [topic] is [wrong / backwards
/ costing you money / making it worse]...
[PAUSE]: [Beat. Let it land.]
[QUALIFIER]: And I don't say that to be clickbait — I say it because
[specific evidence or reason]...
[PIVOT]: Let me show you what [experts / the data / the research]
actually says...
```

**Example (Education niche):**

```
Studying more does NOT help you learn faster. [Pause.] And I don't
say that to be provocative — I say it because a 2024 meta-analysis
of 47 studies found that the #1 predictor of exam performance isn't
study hours. It's something most students have never even heard of.
Let me show you.
```

---

### 3. Mid-Action Drop

**When to use:** When you have a visual result, achievement, or process to show. Drop the viewer into the climax, then explain how you got there. Best for tutorials, challenges, and tech content.

**Template:**

```
[ACTION/RESULT]: [Describe or show the impressive result, mid-process
moment, or dramatic visual]...
[TEASE]: Now let me show you exactly how [I did this / this works /
you can do the same thing]...
[CONTEXT]: It started when [brief origin of the journey]...
```

**Example (Tech niche):**

```
[Screen recording: a fully deployed SaaS app with live users.]
This app makes $4,200 a month — and I built it in a single weekend
using a tool most developers have never touched. Now let me show
you exactly how, step by step.
```

---

### 4. Confession

**When to use:** When vulnerability builds trust and the mistake is relatable. Powerful for personal finance, lifestyle, motivation, and any niche where the creator's journey is the content.

**Template:**

```
[VULNERABILITY]: I [specific mistake, failure, or embarrassing truth]...
[PAUSE]: [Beat. Let the weight land.]
[CONSEQUENCE]: And it cost me [specific measurable consequence —
money, time, reputation, health]...
[REDEMPTION TEASE]: But what happened next changed everything...
```

**Example (Finance niche):**

```
I lost $47,000 in 6 months. [Pause.] Not to a scam. Not to a
market crash. To my own ignorance — because I thought I was too
smart to need a budget. And what I learned from hitting rock bottom
is the reason I'll never be broke again.
```

---

### 5. Unanswered Question

**When to use:** When the video explores a mystery, investigates a question, or tests a hypothesis. Ideal for science, documentary, true crime, and experiment-based content.

**Template:**

```
[INTRIGUING QUESTION]: What happens when [specific, vivid,
curiosity-triggering scenario]?
[VISUAL CUT]: [Cut to title card, dramatic visual, or montage]
[EXPANSION]: [Optional: add 1 sentence of context that deepens
the mystery without answering it]
```

**Example (Science niche):**

```
What happens when you put 100 fire ants on a single drop of honey
— and then add a scorpion? [Cut to terrarium close-up.] Scientists
have studied this for decades, and the answer is way more disturbing
than you'd think.
```

---

## Re-Hook Templates

> **Purpose:** Re-hooks are mini attention resets placed at the 25%, 50%, and 75% marks of the video. They combat the natural attention decay curve and keep viewers locked in through the mid-section (where most drop-off occurs).

**Placement guide:**
- **25% mark** — First re-hook. The initial hook energy is fading.
- **50% mark** — Critical re-hook. This is the "valley of death" for retention.
- **75% mark** — Final re-hook. Push them to the finish line and CTA.

---

### Mini-Tease

**When to use:** When the next section contains genuinely surprising or valuable information.

```
But the next part is where it gets really [interesting / dangerous /
expensive / weird] — because [brief tease of what's coming without
revealing it]...
```

---

### Stakes Reminder

**When to use:** When the viewer might be losing urgency. Re-activate the "cost of leaving" feeling.

```
Remember — if you [leave now / skip this part / miss this step],
[specific consequence that ties back to the original hook's stakes]...
```

---

### Curiosity Bridge

**When to use:** When transitioning between major sections. Closes one loop and opens another.

```
Now that you know [thing just covered], the real question becomes:
[new, intriguing question that the next section answers]...
```

---

### Social Proof Drop

**When to use:** When you can reference an authority, community, or surprising reaction to build credibility mid-video.

```
When I showed this to [specific authority, expert, or group],
their reaction was [surprising reaction] — and here's why that
matters for you...
```

---

### Direct Challenge

**When to use:** When you want to create active engagement and make the viewer feel like a participant, not a passenger.

```
Pause right now and [guess what happened next / try to answer this
/ write down your number]. Seriously — the answer is going to
surprise you...
```

---

### Pattern Interrupt Question

**When to use:** When the pacing feels too steady and you need to jolt the viewer's attention.

```
Now here's the question nobody asks: [unexpected angle on the
topic that reframes what they just learned]...
```

---

## Hook Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any hook, verify:

- [ ] **First sentence grabs in under 3 seconds** -- Could you read it aloud in one breath?
- [ ] **Specific, not generic** -- Does it contain numbers, names, or concrete details?
- [ ] **Creates a knowledge gap** -- Does the viewer need to keep watching to close the loop?
- [ ] **Matches the audience's awareness level** -- Unaware audiences need education; aware audiences need urgency.
- [ ] **Delivers on the thumbnail/title promise** -- The hook must connect to what the click promised.
- [ ] **No wasted words** -- Every word in the first 15 seconds earns its place or gets cut.
- [ ] **Passes the "Would I keep watching?" test** -- Read it aloud. If you'd scroll past, rewrite it.
