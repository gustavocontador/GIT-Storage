  # PARADOX 1: The Simplicity Paradox
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  - id: EP-001
    name: "The Simplicity Paradox"
    category: "business_strategy"
    statement: "Simpler = More Powerful"
    description: |
      The businesses that appear simplest on the surface are the most powerful —
      but achieving that simplicity requires immense depth, experience, and
      ruthless elimination. Simple is not easy. Simple is the result of
      understanding something so deeply that you can strip away everything
      unnecessary.
    conventional_wisdom: "More features, more offerings, more complexity = more value and competitive advantage"
    paradox_truth: "Radical simplicity — fewer products, fewer clients, fewer systems — creates MORE value, MORE profit, and MORE freedom"
    resolution: |
      Simplicity is not starting simple. It's the OUTPUT of deep understanding.
      You must first understand the complexity, then compress it.

      Traffic + Offers = Business. That's it. Two variables.
      Most entrepreneurs add variables to feel productive.
      The masters remove variables to be effective.
    application:
      business: "Reduce product line to 1-3 offers. Each must be irresistible. Kill everything else."
      content: "One Big Idea per piece. APAG structure. No tangents, no filler."
      life: "80/20 everything. If it doesn't pass the sovereignty test, eliminate it."
    diagnostic_question: "If I could only have ONE product, ONE channel, ONE audience — what would I choose?"
    source: "Dan Koe — Digital Economics, The Art of Focus, 'Traffic + Offers = Business'"
    related_paradoxes: ["EP-004", "EP-005"]
    example:
      complex_approach: "Creator with 12 products, 6 funnels, 4 team members, $200K revenue, working 60h/week"
      simple_approach: "Creator with 2 products, 1 funnel, solo, $500K revenue, working 20h/week"
      lesson: "The second creator understood which 20% of activities drove 80% of results — and eliminated the rest."

  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # PARADOX 2: The Niche Paradox
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  - id: EP-002
    name: "The Niche Paradox"
    category: "positioning"
    statement: "You ARE the niche. Don't niche down — niche UP."
    description: |
      Conventional advice says to niche down into an ever-narrower specialty.
      But in the creator economy, the opposite is true. Your unique intersection
      of skills, obsessions, and experience IS the niche. Nobody can compete
      with you being you. Narrowing down means competing in a category someone
      else defined. Niching up means creating a category only you can occupy.
    conventional_wisdom: "Pick a narrow niche, become the specialist, serve one specific audience"
    paradox_truth: "Your unique combination of domains, experiences, and interests is the niche — and it's impossible to compete with"
    resolution: |
      Traditional niching assumes competition within existing categories.
      Personal Monopoly thinking creates NEW categories at intersections.

      Dan Koe doesn't compete in "marketing" or "productivity" or "philosophy."
      He occupies the intersection of all three — a category of one.

      The narrower you niche, the more competitors you have (they all niched
      to the same spot). The more uniquely YOU, the fewer competitors exist (zero).
    application:
      positioning: "Map your intersection: Skills + Obsessions + Experience = Personal Monopoly"
      content: "Write about YOUR unique intersection, not a generic topic"
      brand: "Name your unique space. Own the category. Stop trying to fit existing boxes."
    diagnostic_question: "Am I competing within someone else's category, or have I created my own?"
    source: "Dan Koe — 'You Are The Niche' (Newsletter), Digital Economics, inspired by Jack Butcher's Personal Monopoly"
    related_paradoxes: ["EP-003", "EP-005"]
    example:
      niche_down: "Fitness tips for busy professionals → competing with 10,000 other fitness creators"
      niche_up: "Philosophy + Fitness + Entrepreneurship = 'The Sovereign Body System' → competing with nobody"
      lesson: "The intersection is the differentiation. There's only one person who lived YOUR specific combination."

  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # PARADOX 3: The Content Paradox
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  - id: EP-003
    name: "The Content Paradox"
    category: "creation_philosophy"
    statement: "Teach to learn. Give to receive."
    description: |
      The more you give away for free, the more you receive in revenue.
      The more you teach, the deeper you learn. Content is not a cost center —
      it's the highest-ROI investment a one-person business can make.
      Every free piece builds trust, demonstrates authority, and creates
      demand for paid offers.
    conventional_wisdom: "Don't give away your best ideas for free — save them for paid products. Content is marketing expense."
    paradox_truth: "Give away your best ideas freely. Teaching deepens understanding. Free content creates demand for paid implementation."
    resolution: |
      The confusion is between INFORMATION and IMPLEMENTATION.

      Information (knowledge, frameworks, ideas) → Give freely.
      Implementation (done-for-you, accountability, systems) → Charge premium.

      People will pay for the journey, not the map.
      The more maps you give away, the more people want you as their guide.

      Teaching also forces clarity. You can't teach what you don't understand.
      Every piece of content deepens your expertise.
    application:
      content_strategy: "Share your best frameworks and ideas publicly. Reserve implementation for paid offers."
      learning: "When you want to master something, teach it. The explanation process reveals gaps in understanding."
      trust_building: "Generous free content builds the trust that makes premium offers convert."
    diagnostic_question: "Am I hoarding knowledge out of scarcity mindset, or am I building trust through generosity?"
    source: "Dan Koe — Newsletter philosophy, Content Cascade strategy, Digital Economics"
    related_paradoxes: ["EP-001", "EP-002"]
    example:
      hoarding_approach: "Creator hides best frameworks behind paywall → low trust, high friction, low conversion"
      generous_approach: "Creator publishes best framework for free in newsletter → 100K subscribers trust them → paid course converts at 5%"
      lesson: "The free newsletter WAS the sales page. Trust converts. Secrecy repels."

  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # PARADOX 4: The Sovereignty Paradox
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  - id: EP-004
    name: "The Sovereignty Paradox"
    category: "life_design"
    statement: "Freedom requires structure. Discipline creates liberty."
    description: |
      True sovereignty — control over time, revenue, creativity, and location —
      is not the absence of structure. It's the result of DELIBERATE structure.
      The most free entrepreneurs have the most disciplined systems.
      Without structure, freedom becomes chaos. Without discipline,
      sovereignty becomes entropy.
    conventional_wisdom: "Freedom means no rules, no schedule, no obligations — do whatever you want whenever you want"
    paradox_truth: "Maximum freedom comes from maximum structure — but structure YOU designed, not structure imposed by others"
    resolution: |
      The distinction is between IMPOSED structure and DESIGNED structure.

      Imposed structure (boss's schedule, client demands, algorithm pressure)
      = loss of sovereignty.

      Designed structure (deep work protocol, content calendar, automation systems)
      = sovereignty enabler.

      The 2-4h deep work protocol is structure.
      The Content Cascade is structure.
      The Queue System is structure.

      These structures ENABLE freedom — they don't restrict it.
      Without them, the day dissolves into reactive chaos.
    application:
      daily: "Design your ideal day structure. Protect deep work. Batch communication. Automate the rest."
      business: "Build systems that run without you. Structure enables absence."
      mindset: "Embrace discipline as the PRICE of freedom, not the opposite of it."
    diagnostic_question: "Is my structure designed by ME or imposed by OTHERS? Designed structure = sovereignty. Imposed structure = captivity."
    source: "Dan Koe — The Art of Focus, 2-4h Deep Work Protocol, Digital Economics"
    related_paradoxes: ["EP-001", "EP-005"]
    example:
      unstructured_freedom: "Creator with no schedule → works 12h sporadically, income fluctuates wildly, anxiety about what to do next"
      structured_freedom: "Creator with rigid 4h morning block + automated systems → works 4h/day, consistent $50K/month, travels freely"
      lesson: "The 4-hour morning block IS the freedom. It's not a constraint — it's the architecture of sovereignty."

  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # PARADOX 5: The Effort Paradox
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  - id: EP-005
    name: "The Effort Paradox"
    category: "productivity_philosophy"
    statement: "Less hustle = More results — when leveraged correctly."
    description: |
      Working fewer hours can produce MORE results than working more hours —
      but only when the fewer hours are spent on leveraged activities.
      Hustle culture confuses effort with results. The entrepreneur who
      works 4 focused hours on high-leverage tasks outperforms the one
      who grinds 14 unfocused hours on low-leverage tasks.
    conventional_wisdom: "More hours = more output = more success. If you're not working hard enough, work harder."
    paradox_truth: "Leveraged work beats hard work. 4 hours of deep work on the right thing > 14 hours of scattered effort on the wrong things."
    resolution: |
      The confusion is between EFFORT and LEVERAGE.

      Effort x Leverage = Results

      High effort, zero leverage = burnout (trading time for money forever)
      Low effort, high leverage = compounding (building assets that work for you)

      The Content Cascade: 2 hours of writing → 20+ pieces distributed → thousands reached.
      That's leverage. Compare to: 20 hours creating 20 individual posts → same reach but 10x the time.

      The Leverage Stack ensures every hour invested compounds.
      Without leverage, more effort just means more exhaustion.
    application:
      daily: "Ask before every task: 'Does this compound?' If no, eliminate or automate."
      content: "Create one deep piece and cascade it. Never create single-use content."
      business: "Build products over services. Build systems over hiring. Build leverage over hours."
    diagnostic_question: "If I work 50% fewer hours next month, what would I STOP doing? Those are the low-leverage activities to eliminate NOW."
    source: "Dan Koe — The Art of Focus, Digital Economics, Newsletter articles on leverage vs hustle"
    related_paradoxes: ["EP-001", "EP-004"]
    example:
      hustle_approach: "Creator works 70h/week: 10h emails, 15h calls, 20h creating mediocre content, 15h admin, 10h social media → $8K/month, exhausted"
      leveraged_approach: "Creator works 25h/week: 10h deep work (content + products), 5h distribution, 5h strategy, 5h community → $40K/month, energized"
      lesson: "The leveraged creator produces 5x the revenue in 1/3 the time because every hour is spent on compounding activities."
