## 3. Pipeline Coverage

```yaml
pipeline_coverage:
  funnel_stages:
    - [ ] Top-of-funnel content (awareness, new audience): >= 40% of calendar
    - [ ] Mid-funnel content (nurture, trust-building): >= 30% of calendar
    - [ ] Bottom-funnel content (conversion, CTA-driven): >= 15% of calendar
    - [ ] Retention content (community, existing customers): >= 10% of calendar
  cta_distribution:
    - [ ] Not every post has a CTA (max 30% of posts)
    - [ ] CTA types varied (newsletter, product, free resource, reply)
    - [ ] Hard sell limited to product launch windows
  content_cascade:
    - [ ] Each week's content traces back to one core idea
    - [ ] Long-form piece is source → derivatives cascade from it
    - [ ] Calendar visualizes the cascade flow (source → derivatives)
```

## 4. Batch Efficiency

```yaml
batch_efficiency:
  creation_batching:
    - [ ] Content creation batched (not daily creation)
    - [ ] Writing batch: 1 session creates 1 week of source content
    - [ ] Visual batch: 1 session creates all graphics for the week
    - [ ] Video batch: 1 session records multiple pieces
  scheduling:
    - [ ] All content scheduled minimum 3 days in advance
    - [ ] Buffer of 1 week of content always ready (emergency reserve)
    - [ ] Scheduling tool configured and automated
  review_cycle:
    - [ ] Weekly review: what performed, what didn't, adjust next week
    - [ ] Monthly review: pillar balance, funnel coverage, growth metrics
    - [ ] Quarterly review: strategy alignment with business goals
```

## 5. Calendar Completeness

```yaml
calendar_completeness:
  structural:
    - [ ] Full month planned with specific topics per slot
    - [ ] Each entry has: platform, format, pillar, funnel stage, status
    - [ ] Holidays and launch dates accounted for
  operational:
    - [ ] Creator assigned (self or AI-assisted) per entry
    - [ ] Deadlines for drafts, reviews, and publish clearly marked
    - [ ] Dependencies between pieces identified (e.g., video before clips)
```

## Scoring

| Category | Items | Points Each | Max |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----|
| Critical — Cadence Per Platform | 13 | 3 | 39 |
| Critical — Pipeline Coverage | 9 | 3 | 27 |
| Standard — Content Variety | 9 | 2 | 18 |
| Standard — Batch Efficiency | 9 | 2 | 18 |
| Bonus — Calendar Completeness | 5 | 1 | 5 |
| **TOTAL** | **45** | | **107** |

### Thresholds
- **PASS**: >= 86 points (80%)
- **CONDITIONAL**: >= 65 points (60%)
- **FAIL**: < 65 points

### If FAIL
1. Fill all empty cadence slots — every platform must meet minimum posting frequency
2. Rebalance pillar and funnel coverage — use the 40/30/15/10 framework
3. Implement batching if not already in place — one-person business cannot sustain daily creation
4. Ensure at least 1 week of buffer content exists before calendar is considered valid
