    time_to_execute: "5-15min"

    how_it_works: |
      2x2 matrix classifying tasks on two axes: Urgency and Importance.
      Produces 4 quadrants:
      - Q1 (Urgent + Important): Do now
      - Q2 (Not Urgent + Important): Schedule
      - Q3 (Urgent + Not Important): Delegate
      - Q4 (Not Urgent + Not Important): Eliminate

    steps:
      - "List all tasks/items to prioritize"
      - "For each item, ask: Is this URGENT? (deadline pressure, time-sensitive)"
      - "For each item, ask: Is this IMPORTANT? (contributes to goals, high impact)"
      - "Place each item in the corresponding quadrant"
      - "Act: Q1=Do now, Q2=Schedule, Q3=Delegate, Q4=Eliminate"

    best_for:
      - "Daily task management"
      - "Personal productivity"
      - "Leadership decisions"
      - "Any general-purpose prioritization"

    not_suitable_for:

    time_to_execute: "10-20min"

    how_it_works: |
      2x2 matrix plotting items on Value (Y-axis) vs. Effort (X-axis):

      - High Value + High Effort = Big Projects (plan carefully)
      - Low Value + Low Effort = Fill-ins (if time permits)
      - Low Value + High Effort = Money Pits (avoid)

    steps:
      - "List all items to prioritize"
      - "Rate each item on Value (1-10): business impact, revenue, user satisfaction"
      - "Rate each item on Effort (1-10): time, cost, complexity"
      - "Plot on 2x2 matrix"

    how_it_works: |
      2x2 matrix categorizing ideas into four quadrants:

      - I (Implement): Easy + High Impact - do it now

    complexity_label: "Medium"
    group_size: "small_team"
    data_required: "moderate"
    time_to_execute: "30-60min"

    how_it_works: |
      Scores each item with 4 factors to produce a single priority score:
      RICE Score = (Reach x Impact x Confidence) / Effort

      - Reach: How many people affected per time period (number)
      - Impact: How much each person is affected (0.25=minimal, 0.5=low, 1=medium, 2=high, 3=massive)
      - Confidence: How sure you are about estimates (100%=high, 80%=medium, 50%=low)
      - Effort: Person-months of work (number)

    steps:
      - "List all features/ideas to score"
      - "For each, estimate Reach (users per quarter)"
      - "For each, rate Impact (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, or 3)"
      - "For each, assess Confidence (50%, 80%, or 100%)"
      - "For each, estimate Effort (person-months)"
      - "Calculate: (Reach x Impact x Confidence) / Effort"

    data_required: "minimal"
    time_to_execute: "10-20min"

    how_it_works: |
      Quick scoring method using 3 criteria (1-10 each):

      - Impact: Potential effect on the business goal (1-10)
      - Confidence: How confident you are it will work (1-10)

    group_size: "small_team"
    data_required: "minimal"
    time_to_execute: "15-30min"

    how_it_works: |
      Each problem is rated 1-5 on three criteria:
      Priority = Gravity x Urgency x Tendency

      - G (Gravity): Impact if problem is not solved (1=minimal, 5=catastrophic)
      - U (Urgency): Time pressure to resolve (1=can wait, 5=immediate)
      - T (Tendency): Likelihood of getting worse over time (1=stable, 5=rapid deterioration)

    steps:
      - "List all problems/issues to prioritize"
      - "Rate each on Gravity (1-5)"
      - "Rate each on Urgency (1-5)"
      - "Rate each on Tendency (1-5)"

    complexity_label: "Medium"
    group_size: "large_team"
    data_required: "moderate"
    time_to_execute: "30-60min"

    how_it_works: |
      Prioritizes by maximum economic return in minimum time:
      WSJF = Cost of Delay / Job Duration

      Cost of Delay is decomposed into:
      - User-Business Value (1-21 fibonacci)
      - Time Criticality (1-21 fibonacci)
      - Risk Reduction / Opportunity Enablement (1-21 fibonacci)

      Uses relative sizing (fibonacci) with team consensus.

    steps:
      - "List all features/epics to prioritize"
      - "Rate User-Business Value (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)"
      - "Rate Time Criticality (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)"
      - "Rate Risk Reduction / Opportunity Enablement (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)"
      - "Sum the three to get Cost of Delay"
      - "Estimate Job Size/Duration (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)"
      - "Calculate: WSJF = Cost of Delay / Job Size"
      - "Rank by WSJF descending"

    data_required: "moderate"
    time_to_execute: "30-60min"

    how_it_works: |
      The most flexible scoring framework:
      1. Define criteria (columns)
      2. Assign weights to each criterion (totaling 100%)
      3. Score each option against each criterion (1-10)
      4. Multiply scores by weights
      5. Sum weighted scores per option
      6. Rank by total weighted score

    steps:
      - "Define 4-8 evaluation criteria relevant to your context"
      - "Assign percentage weight to each criterion (must total 100%)"
      - "List all options to evaluate"
      - "Score each option on each criterion (1-10)"
      - "Multiply each score by its weight"
      - "Sum weighted scores for each option"
      - "Rank by total weighted score"

    best_for:

    complexity: 3
    complexity_label: "High"
    group_size: "large_team"
    data_required: "extensive"
    time_to_execute: "60-120min"

    how_it_works: |
      Quantifies the economic impact of delaying a feature/project:
      CD3 = Cost of Delay / Duration

      Cost of Delay profiles:
      - Standard: Linear value decay over time
      - Urgent: Steep early value loss
      - Fixed Date: Cliff at deadline
      - Intangible: Hard to quantify but real

      Requires estimating revenue impact, market window, and opportunity cost.

    steps:
      - "Identify the value stream for each item"
      - "Estimate weekly/monthly revenue impact of delay"
      - "Classify the urgency profile (standard, urgent, fixed-date, intangible)"
      - "Estimate implementation duration"
      - "Calculate CD3 = Cost of Delay / Duration"
      - "Rank by CD3 descending"

    best_for:

    time_to_execute: "15-30min"

    how_it_works: |
      Classifies requirements/tasks into 4 categories:
      - Must have (M): Indispensable; project fails without it
      - Should have (S): Important but not fatal if missing
      - Could have (C): Desirable; only if time/resources allow
      - Won't have (W): Discarded for this cycle (may return later)

      Rule of thumb: Must-haves should be ~60% of effort, Should-haves ~20%.

    steps:
      - "List all requirements/features"
      - "For each, ask: Does the project FAIL without this? → Must have"
      - "If not critical, ask: Is this IMPORTANT for success? → Should have"
      - "If nice-to-have, ask: Would users APPRECIATE this? → Could have"

    how_it_works: |
      Classifies features based on customer satisfaction using paired questionnaires:
      1. Basic (Must-be): Expected; absence causes dissatisfaction, presence doesn't delight
      2. Performance (One-dimensional): More = more satisfaction (linear)
      3. Attractive (Delighters): Surprise positively; absence doesn't bother
      4. Indifferent: No effect on satisfaction
      5. Reverse: Presence causes dissatisfaction

      Requires customer surveys with functional/dysfunctional question pairs.

    steps:
      - "Create feature list to evaluate"
      - "Design Kano questionnaire (functional + dysfunctional for each feature)"
      - "Survey customers (minimum 20-30 responses)"
      - "Map responses to Kano categories using evaluation table"

      - C: Nice to do - no consequences either way
      - D: Delegate - can be done by someone else
      - E: Eliminate - not needed at all

      Within A tasks, sub-rank as A-1, A-2, A-3. Always start with A-1.

    steps:

      Great products balance all three. Each bucket serves a different purpose.

    steps:
      - "List all features on the roadmap"
      - "For each, ask: Does this move a KEY METRIC? → Metrics Movers"
      - "Ask: Are customers EXPLICITLY requesting this? → Customer Requests"

      Empirical principle: 80% of results come from 20% of causes.
      Applied to prioritization:
      1. List all tasks/items
      2. Identify the 20% that generate 80% of impact
      3. Focus effort on those 20%

      Not a formula but a decision lens that complements other methods.

    steps:
      - "List all tasks/problems/opportunities"
      - "Estimate the impact/value of each"
      - "Sort by impact descending"
      - "Identify the top 20% (the vital few)"
      - "Concentrate effort on these items first"
      - "Apply to the remaining 80% only if capacity allows"
