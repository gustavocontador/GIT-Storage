## 1. Surface Layer (Above the Waterline)

```yaml
surface_layer:
  simplicity:
    - [ ] Big Idea expressed in one sentence
    - [ ] A 12-year-old could understand the surface explanation
    - [ ] No jargon in the surface layer
    - [ ] The surface creates curiosity to go deeper
  accessibility:
    - [ ] Surface layer works as a standalone social media post
    - [ ] Surface layer works as a tweet or headline
    - [ ] The "hook" lives at the surface — not buried in depth
    - [ ] Surface immediately signals value to the reader
```

---

## 2. Depth Layer (Below the Waterline)

```yaml
depth_layer:
  research_backing:
    - [ ] Minimum 3 credible sources supporting the Big Idea
    - [ ] At least 1 source from academic or scientific research
    - [ ] At least 1 source from practitioner experience
    - [ ] Sources are diverse (not all from the same thought leader)
  substance:
    - [ ] Depth provides genuine "aha" moments for knowledgeable readers
    - [ ] Depth explains WHY the surface truth is true
    - [ ] Depth includes nuances, edge cases, and exceptions
    - [ ] Depth would satisfy a skeptic's "prove it" challenge
```

---

## 3. Ratio Validation

```yaml
ratio:
  surface_to_depth:
    - [ ] Surface layer is 10-20% of total content length
    - [ ] Depth layer is 80-90% of total content length
    - [ ] The ratio creates the "iceberg effect" — readers discover there is much more
  effort_allocation:
    - [ ] 80% of research time spent on depth (not surface polish)
    - [ ] Surface crafted AFTER depth is complete (not before)
    - [ ] Depth determines surface — not the other way around
```

---

## 4. Depth Integration

```yaml
integration:
  cross_domain:
    - [ ] Depth draws from 2+ knowledge domains
    - [ ] Cross-domain connections strengthen the argument
    - [ ] Each domain contributes unique evidence or perspective
  pattern_recognition:
    - [ ] Underlying patterns identified across sources
    - [ ] Patterns named and made explicit
    - [ ] Patterns reusable in future content (framework building)
    - [ ] Depth reveals a principle, not just a collection of facts
```

---

## 5. Content Application

```yaml
content_application:
  format_adaptation:
    - [ ] Surface layer deployed in short-form content (tweets, shorts)
    - [ ] Full iceberg deployed in long-form content (newsletter, YouTube, course)
    - [ ] Depth layers can be progressively revealed (content cascade potential)
    - [ ] Each depth layer could be its own standalone piece
  audience_calibration:
    - [ ] Beginner readers get value from surface alone
    - [ ] Intermediate readers discover depth and feel rewarded
    - [ ] Advanced readers find nuance and novelty in the deepest layers
    - [ ] Each audience level feels "this was written for me"
```

---

## 6. Quality Gate

```yaml
quality_gate:
  veto_conditions:
    - [ ] VETO if surface is complex and requires explanation
    - [ ] VETO if depth is shallow (fewer than 3 sources)
    - [ ] VETO if surface and depth tell the same story (no iceberg effect)
  excellence_markers:
    - [ ] Reader reaction: "I thought I understood this, but now I REALLY understand it"
    - [ ] Content can be expanded into a course module
    - [ ] The insight is quotable at the surface level
```

## Scoring

| Category | Items | Points Each | Max |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----|
| Critical — Surface Simplicity & Depth Substance | 12 | 3 | 36 |
| Standard — Ratio, Integration & Application | 14 | 2 | 28 |
| Bonus — Quality Gate & Excellence Markers | 6 | 1 | 6 |
| **TOTAL** | **32** | | **70** |

### Thresholds
- **PASS**: >= 56 points (80%)
- **CONDITIONAL**: >= 42 points (60%)
- **FAIL**: < 42 points

### If FAIL
1. Rewrite the surface layer: if you cannot say it in one sentence, you do not understand it yet
2. Add research: find 3 sources that PROVE the Big Idea, not just illustrate it
3. Test the iceberg: share the surface with a friend, then reveal the depth — did they say "wow"?
4. If surface = depth, you have a flat idea. Go deeper or find a different angle.
