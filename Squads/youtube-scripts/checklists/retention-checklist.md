## How to Use This Checklist

1. Have the full script ready with estimated timestamps (or calculate at 150 wpm).
2. Work through each section in order, filling in the inventory tables.
3. Check each validation item as you go.
4. Calculate the retention score at the end.
5. Any failed Critical item requires immediate revision.

## 7. GOLDEN THREAD CONSISTENCY

### Golden Thread Statement

**Golden Thread:** "_______________________________________________________________"

(One sentence that connects all sections to the grand payoff.)

### Thread Reference Check

|--------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Hook         | Yes / No          | "___"                    | ___             |

## 8. CURIOSITY GAP DENSITY CHECK

### Curiosity Moments

Count every moment in the script that creates a curiosity gap (a question the viewer wants answered):

| # | Position | Curiosity Text (excerpt)             | Type                        | Resolved? |
|---|----------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | ___      | "___"                                | Question / Mystery / Tease  | Yes / No  |
| 2 | ___      | "___"                                | Question / Mystery / Tease  | Yes / No  |
| 3 | ___      | "___"                                | Question / Mystery / Tease  | Yes / No  |
| 4 | ___      | "___"                                | Question / Mystery / Tease  | Yes / No  |
| 5 | ___      | "___"                                | Question / Mystery / Tease  | Yes / No  |
| ... | ...    | ...                                  | ...                         | ...       |

### Density Validation

- [ ] **(Critical)** At least 1 curiosity gap per 2 minutes of content.
- [ ] **(Warning)** Curiosity gaps are spread throughout (not clustered in one section).
- [ ] **(Warning)** Types vary — not all questions, not all teasers.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** All curiosity gaps are eventually resolved (or intentionally left for future content).
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Curiosity density is highest in the first 25% (front-loaded engagement).
