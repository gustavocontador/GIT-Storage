# Conversion Script Template

> **Purpose:** This template is for YouTube scripts designed to SELL — whether that's a product, service, course, coaching, or affiliate offer. Conversion scripts are fundamentally different from educational or entertainment scripts. They follow direct-response copywriting principles (Problem-Agitate-Solve, Hormozi's Value Equation, Schwartz's Awareness Stages) and are optimized for a SINGLE GOAL: getting the viewer to take action.
>
> **How to use:** Use this template when the brief indicates a sales/conversion objective OR when the video includes a paid product CTA. This template prioritizes persuasion mechanics over pure retention — though high retention is still critical (viewers must watch long enough to be sold).

[1] OFFER METADATA
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Product/Service Name:

  → What is being sold? Be specific. Example: "YouTube Growth Accelerator
    Course," "1-on-1 Coaching Program," "Affiliate: Shopify (14-day trial)"

Price Point:
  [ ] Free (lead magnet)
  [ ] Low-ticket ($1-$50)
  [ ] Mid-ticket ($50-$500)
  [ ] High-ticket ($500-$5,000+)

  → Actual price: $_____
  → Payment structure: {One-time / Monthly / Annual / Pay-what-you-want}

Primary CTA (Call-to-Action):

  → The SINGLE action you want the viewer to take. Be hyper-specific:
    - Bad: "Check the link in the description"
    - Good: "Click the first link in the description to start your
            free 7-day trial — no credit card required"

CTA Link Destination:

  → Where does the link go?
    - Sales page URL
    - Checkout page (direct purchase)
    - Lead magnet landing page
    - Webinar registration
    - Affiliate link

Awareness Level of Audience *:
  [ ] Unaware        — Don't know the problem exists (educate first)
  [ ] Problem-Aware  — Know the problem, not the solution (introduce solution)
  [ ] Solution-Aware — Know solutions exist, not yours (differentiate)
  [ ] Product-Aware  — Know your product, haven't bought (overcome objections)
  [ ] Most Aware     — Ready to buy, need final push (urgency + scarcity)

  → This determines the script structure. Unaware audiences need 60%+
    education, 40% pitch. Most Aware audiences need 20% education,
    80% pitch + urgency.

Conversion Goal (pick ONE):
  [ ] Direct Sale (buy now)
  [ ] Lead Capture (email signup, free trial)
  [ ] Affiliate Click (earn commission)
  [ ] Webinar Registration (sell on webinar)
  [ ] Application/Call Booking (high-ticket sales call)

Target Length:                        ___ minutes

  → Conversion scripts often run longer (10-20 min) because you need
    time to build value, handle objections, and close. Shorter (5-8 min)
    works for low-ticket or highly aware audiences.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[2] SCRIPT STRUCTURE — PROBLEM-AGITATE-SOLVE (PAS)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  → Conversion scripts follow a PROVEN structure. Do NOT deviate unless
    you have a strong strategic reason. The PAS framework works because
    it mirrors how humans make buying decisions: awareness of pain →
    emotional amplification → relief through solution.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECTION 1: HOOK (0:00-0:30)
Stakes + Promise + Curiosity Gap

[GOAL: Stop the scroll, identify the target audience, make a big promise]

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

{Script text:}

If you've been trying to grow your YouTube channel for months —
uploading every week, optimizing your thumbnails, following all the
"expert advice" — and you're STILL stuck under 1,000 subscribers...
this might be the most important video you ever watch.

In the next 12 minutes, I'm going to show you the exact 3-step system
that took me from 47 subscribers to 100,000 in 9 months. And at the
end, I'll give you free access to the same checklist I used for every
single video that went viral.

But first, let me tell you why everything you've been taught about
YouTube growth is backwards.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  → Hook Breakdown:
    - "If you've been trying to grow..." = TARGET AUDIENCE (struggling creators)
    - "...stuck under 1,000 subscribers" = PAIN POINT (relatable problem)
    - "most important video you ever watch" = STAKES (high value claim)
    - "exact 3-step system" = PROMISE (clear, specific outcome)
    - "free access to the same checklist" = HOOK (ethical bribe, open loop)
    - "everything you've been taught is backwards" = CURIOSITY GAP

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECTION 2: PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION (0:30-2:00)
Describe the Pain in Detail

[GOAL: Make the viewer nod and think "Yes, that's exactly my problem"]

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

{Script text:}

Here's the truth no one tells you. You've been told that consistency
is the key — just post every week and the algorithm will reward you.
You've been told to "find your niche" and "be authentic." You've
spent hours learning about CTR, AVD, and watch time.

And yet... nothing's working.

You upload a video you spent 10 hours on. You check the analytics
the next day. 34 views. 12 of them are from your mom.

You look at other creators in your niche — people who started AFTER
you — and they're already at 10K, 50K, 100K subscribers. And you're
thinking: "What am I doing wrong?"

Here's what's actually happening...

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  → Problem Section Tactics:
    - Use "You" language (second person) to make it personal
    - List common symptoms the audience experiences (low views, slow growth)
    - Acknowledge the "obvious" advice they've already tried (consistency, niche)
    - Show empathy: "I've been there" or "You're not alone"
    - Transition with "Here's what's actually happening..." (bridge to agitate)

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECTION 3: AGITATE THE PAIN (2:00-4:00)
Make the Problem VIVID and URGENT

[GOAL: Amplify the emotional cost of NOT solving the problem]

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

{Script text:}

The reason you're stuck isn't because you're not working hard enough.
It's because you're optimizing for the WRONG metrics.

Every hour you spend editing a video that gets 50 views is an hour
you'll never get back. Every week you wait for "the algorithm to kick in"
is a week your competitors are passing you.

And here's the worst part: the longer you stay small, the harder it
gets to grow. Because YouTube's algorithm rewards channels that are
ALREADY growing. If you're not gaining momentum NOW, you're actively
falling behind.

Think about it. How long have you been doing this? 6 months? A year?
Two years? How much longer are you willing to grind without results?

Because I can tell you from experience: if you don't fix this, you'll
be in the exact same place a year from now. Same subscriber count.
Same view counts. Same frustration.

Unless you change something TODAY.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  → Agitate Section Tactics:
    - Amplify the COST of inaction (time wasted, competitors winning)
    - Use vivid imagery ("every hour you'll never get back")
    - Introduce URGENCY ("the longer you wait, the harder it gets")
    - Ask painful questions ("How long are you willing to grind?")
    - Paint the "nightmare future" (same place a year from now)
    - End with a turning point: "Unless you change something TODAY"

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECTION 4: SOLUTION INTRODUCTION (4:00-5:30)
Bridge from Pain to Product

[GOAL: Position your product as the INEVITABLE solution to the pain]

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

{Script text:}

So what's the solution?

It's not more consistency. It's not better thumbnails. It's not
"finding your niche."

It's understanding the ONE thing that separates channels that blow up
from channels that stay stuck: they know how to engineer a hit BEFORE
they ever hit record.

Let me explain.

When I was stuck at 47 subscribers, I was doing what everyone else does:
I'd come up with a video idea, film it, edit it, post it, and hope.
And hope doesn't scale.

Then I discovered a framework — a system that the top 1% of creators
use but never talk about — that lets you PREDICT whether a video will
go viral before you even make it.

I tested it. And my next video got 12,000 views in the first 48 hours.
The one after that? 35,000 views. And the one after that hit 100K.

I reverse-engineered what was working, turned it into a repeatable
process, and used it to grow from 47 subscribers to 100,000 in 9 months.

And now, I've packaged that entire system into a step-by-step course
called the YouTube Growth Accelerator.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  → Solution Intro Tactics:
    - Negate false solutions first ("It's not more consistency...")
    - Introduce the REAL problem (lack of a system)
    - Tell your origin story (relatability: "I was stuck too")
    - Show proof of transformation (47 → 100K subscribers)
    - Name the product naturally ("YouTube Growth Accelerator")
    - Position it as a SYSTEM, not just information

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECTION 5: VALUE STACK (5:30-8:00)
What They Get (Hormozi Value Equation)

[GOAL: Maximize PERCEIVED value, minimize PERCEIVED effort and risk]

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  → Hormozi's Value Equation:
    Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Success) ÷
            (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)

  → In plain English:
    - Increase the DREAM (what they'll achieve)
    - Increase the LIKELIHOOD (proof it works)
    - Decrease the TIME (results come fast)
    - Decrease the EFFORT (make it easy)

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

{Script text:}

Here's what you get inside the YouTube Growth Accelerator:

**Module 1: The Viral Video Formula**
You'll learn the exact framework I use to predict whether a video
will hit 10K, 100K, or 1M+ views BEFORE I film it. This is the same
system that took my channel from 0 to 100K — and it works in ANY niche.

**Module 2: The Title & Thumbnail System**
I'll show you the 7 psychological triggers that make people CLICK —
and the 3 templates I use for 90% of my thumbnails. You'll never
stare at a blank Photoshop canvas again.

**Module 3: The Retention Blueprint**
This is where most creators fail. You'll get my 9-point checklist
for keeping viewers hooked from 0:00 to the end. Higher retention =
algorithm boost = more views.

**Module 4: The Launch Strategy**
The first 48 hours determine whether your video succeeds or dies.
I'll show you the exact launch checklist I use to maximize early
momentum and trigger the algorithm.

**BONUS: The Viral Video Checklist (PDF)**
A one-page checklist you can print and use for every video. This
alone is worth the price of the course.

**BONUS: Private Community Access**
Join 1,200+ creators inside our private Discord. Get feedback on
your videos, share wins, and learn from people who are ACTUALLY
growing (not just talking about it).

Total value if you bought these separately: $997.

But you're not paying $997 today.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  → Value Stack Tactics:
    - List modules/components as OUTCOMES, not features
    - Use "You'll get" language (they're already imagining owning it)
    - Quantify where possible (7 triggers, 9-point checklist)
    - Add BONUSES (increase perceived value without raising price)
    - Anchor to a HIGH price first ("$997 value") before revealing real price

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECTION 6: SOCIAL PROOF (8:00-9:00)
Testimonials, Results, Numbers

[GOAL: Prove that OTHER PEOPLE like them got results]

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

{Script text:}

Now, you might be thinking: "Does this actually work for people who
aren't you?"

Great question. Let me show you.

Sarah joined the course 3 months ago. She had 240 subscribers. She
applied the Viral Video Formula to her next upload. It got 47,000
views in the first week. She's now at 8,200 subscribers and growing.

Mike was stuck at 1,500 subscribers for over a year. He took the
course, implemented the Title & Thumbnail System, and his next 3
videos averaged 22,000 views each. He hit 10K subscribers last month.

Emily had never made a YouTube video before. She went through the
modules, posted her first video using the framework, and it got
12,000 views. Her channel is 6 weeks old and she already has 1,800
subscribers.

These aren't outliers. This is what happens when you have a SYSTEM
instead of just "trying stuff and hoping."

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  → Social Proof Tactics:
    - Use REAL names (or "Student A" if anonymity required)
    - Include BEFORE numbers (relatability: they were stuck too)
    - Include AFTER numbers (proof of transformation)
    - Include TIMEFRAME (fast results = higher perceived value)
    - End with a reframe: "This is what happens when you have a system"

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECTION 7: OBJECTION HANDLING (9:00-10:30)
Pre-Answer the Top 3 Objections

[GOAL: Remove mental barriers BEFORE they become reasons not to buy]

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

{Script text:}

Now, I know what you might be thinking.

**Objection 1: "I don't have time to take a course."**
Fair. But here's the thing: you're already spending 10-20 hours a
week making videos that don't work. This course takes 3 hours to
complete. You'll save MORE time by learning the system once than
you'll waste guessing for the next 6 months.

**Objection 2: "I've tried other courses and they didn't work."**
I get it. Most YouTube courses are taught by people who got lucky
once or who teach theory they've never tested. I'm different. I'm
still actively growing my channel using this EXACT system. Every
module is based on what I do every single week.

**Objection 3: "What if this doesn't work for my niche?"**
I've had students in finance, gaming, cooking, true crime, tech
reviews, meditation, fitness — you name it. The framework is
niche-agnostic because it's based on HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY, not trends.
If your audience is human, this works.

Still not sure? That's why I'm including a 30-day money-back guarantee.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  → Objection Handling Tactics:
    - Name the objection OUT LOUD ("I know what you're thinking...")
    - Validate it first ("Fair." / "I get it.")
    - Reframe with logic or proof (time math, credibility, testimonials)
    - Address the TOP 3 objections only (don't plant new doubts)
    - Transition to risk reversal (guarantee)

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECTION 8: THE OFFER + PRICE REVEAL (10:30-11:00)
Close the Sale

[GOAL: Make the decision EASY and URGENT]

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

{Script text:}

So here's the deal.

The YouTube Growth Accelerator normally sells for $297. But because
you're watching this video, I'm giving you access for just $97.

That's less than the cost of dinner for two. And it could be the
difference between spending another year stuck at 500 subscribers...
or hitting 10K in the next 90 days.

Here's what you need to do:

Click the first link in the description right now. You'll be taken
to the checkout page. Enter your email. Complete the purchase. And
you'll get INSTANT access to all 4 modules, both bonuses, and the
private community.

Do it now — because this $97 price is only available through this
video. If you come back later, it goes back to $297.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  → Offer/Close Tactics:
    - Anchor to NORMAL price first ($297)
    - Reveal DISCOUNTED price ($97) as a special deal
    - Frame the price as SMALL compared to value ("less than dinner")
    - Contrast inaction cost vs. action cost (stuck vs. 10K subs)
    - Give EXPLICIT step-by-step instructions (click, enter email, etc.)
    - Add urgency/scarcity (price goes up later, limited spots, etc.)

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECTION 9: RISK REVERSAL (11:00-11:30)
Remove ALL Perceived Risk

[GOAL: Make the decision NO-RISK for the buyer]

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

{Script text:}

And just so we're clear: you have ZERO risk here.

If you go through the course, apply the system, and don't see results
in 30 days — or if you just decide it's not for you for ANY reason —
send me an email and I'll refund every penny. No questions asked.

You either get the results you want, or you get your money back.
That's how confident I am that this works.

So the only way you lose is if you do nothing.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  → Risk Reversal Tactics:
    - Offer a GUARANTEE (money-back, results guarantee, etc.)
    - Make the guarantee LONGER than typical (30-60 days, not 7)
    - Use "No questions asked" language (reduces friction)
    - Reframe: "The only way you lose is if you do nothing"

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECTION 10: FINAL CTA + CLOSE (11:30-12:00)
Last Push

[GOAL: Final emotional appeal + clear action step]

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

{Script text:}

Look, a year from now, you're going to be somewhere. The question is:
where?

You can keep doing what you're doing — posting videos, hoping for the
best, watching other creators pass you by. Or you can take 3 hours,
learn the system, and finally start seeing the growth you deserve.

The link is in the description. Click it. Get started.

I'll see you inside the course.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  → Final CTA Tactics:
    - Use FUTURE PACING ("A year from now, where will you be?")
    - Present TWO PATHS (stay stuck vs. take action)
    - Keep it SHORT (don't re-explain the offer)
    - End with IDENTITY language ("I'll see you inside" = they're already in)


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[3] CTA PLACEMENT MAP
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  → Conversion scripts often include MULTIPLE CTAs — not just at the end.
    This map shows where each CTA appears and what type it is.

| Timestamp | CTA Type               | CTA Text                               | Purpose               |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| 0:25      | Soft CTA (hook)        | "...free checklist at the end"         | Open loop, keep watching |
| 5:30      | Product Introduction   | "...called YouTube Growth Accelerator" | Name the product      |
| 10:45     | Hard CTA (close)       | "Click the link in the description"    | Direct purchase ask   |
| 11:15     | Urgency CTA            | "Do it now — price goes up later"      | Scarcity trigger      |
| 11:50     | Final CTA (emotional)  | "The link is in the description..."    | Last chance push      |

  → Best Practice: Place the HARD CTA after the value stack and social
    proof (not before). Viewers need to be SOLD before you ask for money.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[4] AWARENESS LEVEL ADAPTATION NOTES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  → How this script changes based on audience awareness level.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

IF AUDIENCE = UNAWARE:
  - Spend 50-60% of video on PROBLEM (they don't know it exists yet)
  - Hook focuses on a SYMPTOM, not the solution
  - Educate BEFORE you sell
  - Example: "Why you're tired all the time (and it's not what you think)"

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

IF AUDIENCE = PROBLEM-AWARE:
  - Spend 30-40% on PROBLEM, 60-70% on SOLUTION
  - Hook acknowledges the problem, promises the solution
  - This is the MOST COMMON awareness level for YouTube
  - Example: "Stuck at 500 subscribers? Here's the system that got me to 100K"

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

IF AUDIENCE = SOLUTION-AWARE:
  - Spend 20% on PROBLEM, 80% on YOUR SPECIFIC SOLUTION
  - Differentiate from competitors ("Why other courses don't work")
  - Focus on PROOF and UNIQUENESS
  - Example: "I've tried 6 YouTube courses. Here's the only one that worked."

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

IF AUDIENCE = PRODUCT-AWARE:
  - Spend 10% on PROBLEM, 90% on OFFER + OBJECTION HANDLING
  - They know YOU, they just haven't bought yet
  - Use urgency, scarcity, and risk reversal HEAVILY
  - Example: "Last chance: YouTube Growth Accelerator closes tonight"

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

IF AUDIENCE = MOST AWARE:
  - Skip PROBLEM entirely, go straight to OFFER
  - Pure urgency/scarcity play
  - Retargeting or email list only (not cold traffic)
  - Example: "Cart closes in 3 hours — final call"

## Specialist Notes: Conversion Script Best Practices

### 1. Conversion ≠ Retention (But You Need Both)
A script can have 60% retention and convert at 5% (great). A script can have 35% retention and convert at 8% (also great). The goal is to keep QUALIFIED viewers (people likely to buy) watching long enough to be sold. Don't sacrifice clarity for retention tricks.

### 2. The Value Equation is Non-Negotiable
Every buying decision comes down to Hormozi's equation:
- **Dream Outcome:** What do they GET? (Be specific: "10K subscribers in 90 days," not "grow your channel")
- **Likelihood:** Why should they believe it works? (Social proof, your credibility)
- **Time Delay:** How fast do they get results? (Faster = more valuable)
- **Effort:** How hard is it? (Easier = more valuable)

Maximize the top, minimize the bottom.

### 3. Objection Handling Wins Sales
Most people don't buy because of unspoken objections:
- "I don't have time"
- "I've been burned before"
- "This won't work for me"

If you don't address these OUT LOUD in the script, they'll use them as reasons to bounce.

### 4. Anchor the Price
NEVER reveal the price cold. Always anchor to a higher number first:
- "This normally sells for $997, but today you pay $97"
- "If you hired me 1-on-1, it's $5,000. The course is $297"

The brain evaluates value RELATIVE to the first number it sees.

### 5. Urgency Must Be REAL
Fake urgency kills trust. If you say "price goes up tomorrow," it better go up tomorrow. Real urgency triggers:
- Limited-time discount (with hard deadline)
- Limited spots (if true, show scarcity proof)
- Bonus removal ("First 100 people get X")
- Seasonal offer (Black Friday, New Year, etc.)

### 6. The CTA Must Be Idiot-Proof
Don't assume viewers know what to do. Spell it out:
- "Click the FIRST link in the description"
- "Scroll down, find the link that says 'Get Instant Access'"
- "Enter your email, click the blue button, complete checkout"

Reduce friction = increase conversions.

### 7. Use PAS, But Adapt It
Problem-Agitate-Solve is the default structure, but you can modify it:
- **PASTOR**: Problem, Amplify, Story, Testimonial, Offer, Response
- **AIDA**: Attention, Interest, Desire, Action
- **HSO**: Hook, Story, Offer

All work. PAS is the simplest and most versatile.
