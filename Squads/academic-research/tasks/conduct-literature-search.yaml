    description: Create search terms with Boolean operators
    agent: literature-reviewer
    estimated_duration: 0.5 days

  - step: 2
    name: search_databases
    description: Execute searches across all specified databases
    agent: literature-reviewer
    estimated_duration: 1 day

  - step: 3
    name: remove_duplicates
    description: Remove duplicate papers across databases

    estimated_duration: 0.5 days

  - step: 4
    name: document_process
    description: Document search strings, results, and process
    agent: literature-reviewer
    estimated_duration: 0.5 days

success_criteria:
  - Comprehensive search across relevant databases
  - Search strategy documented with exact strings
  - Duplicates removed
  - Results exported in usable format
  - For systematic reviews: PRISMA guidelines followed

deliverables:
  - CSV/Excel file with all papers (Title, Authors, Year, Abstract, DOI)
  - Search strategy document with all search strings
  - PRISMA flow diagram (if systematic review)
  - Reference library file (Zotero/Mendeley/EndNote)

best_practices:
  - Use broad search initially, then screen (better than narrow search)
  - Combine multiple search terms with Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)
  - Use wildcards for word variations (educat* → education, educational)
  - Use MeSH terms in PubMed for medical topics
  - Search title, abstract, and keywords (not just title)
  - Include grey literature (theses, reports, preprints)
  - Use forward/backward citation snowballing
  - Document date of search and database versions

search_strategy_example:
  query: |
    (artificial intelligence OR machine learning OR deep learning)
    AND
    (education OR learning OR teaching)
    AND
    (personalized learning OR adaptive learning)
  databases:
    - PubMed: "AI[Title/Abstract] AND education[Title/Abstract]"
    - Scopus: "TITLE-ABS-KEY(artificial AND intelligence AND education)"
    - Web of Science: "TS=(artificial intelligence AND education)"

common_pitfalls:
  - Search too narrow (miss relevant papers)
  - Search too broad (thousands of irrelevant papers)
  - Not documenting search process (can't replicate)
  - Ignoring grey literature (publication bias)
  - Not checking reference lists of key papers
