2. Work through each section sequentially, auditing conversion effectiveness.
3. Test script against the target audience's awareness level.
4. Calculate the conversion score at the end.
5. Any failed Critical item requires immediate revision before publishing.

## 1. VALUE EQUATION CHECK

### Value Equation Components

**Alex Hormozi's Value Equation:** Value = (Dream Outcome × Likelihood) / (Time × Effort)

Map all 4 elements in the script:

| Element | Present? | Location (timestamp/section) | Exact Text (excerpt) | Strength (1-10) |
|---------|---------|------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Dream Outcome** (what they want) | Yes / No | ___ | "___" | ___ |
| **Likelihood** (belief they can achieve it) | Yes / No | ___ | "___" | ___ |
| **Time** (speed to result) | Yes / No | ___ | "___" | ___ |
| **Effort** (ease of implementation) | Yes / No | ___ | "___" | ___ |

### Validation

- [ ] **(Critical)** All 4 Value Equation elements are addressed in the script.
- [ ] **(Critical)** Dream Outcome is specific and emotional (not vague like "make money" — specific like "earn $10K/mo passive income").
- [ ] **(Critical)** Likelihood is backed by proof (testimonials, data, case studies, your own results).
- [ ] **(Warning)** Time and Effort are minimized or addressed (fast results + easy implementation).
- [ ] **(Warning)** Value Equation is presented before any CTA (value first, ask second).
- [ ] **(Warning)** Script emphasizes increasing Dream Outcome and Likelihood more than reducing Time and Effort (top of equation > bottom).
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Value Equation is implicit, not explicitly stated (feels natural, not formula-driven).

**Value Equation completeness score (1-10):** ___

## 2. CTA PLACEMENT

### CTA Inventory

List every CTA in the script:

| CTA # | Position (timestamp) | CTA Text | Value Peak Before CTA? | Duration (sec) | CTA Type |
|-------|---------------------|----------|------------------------|----------------|----------|
| 1 | ___ | "___" | Yes / No | ___ | Soft / Hard / Hybrid |
| 2 | ___ | "___" | Yes / No | ___ | Soft / Hard / Hybrid |
| 3 | ___ | "___" | Yes / No | ___ | Soft / Hard / Hybrid |
| 4 | ___ | "___" | Yes / No | ___ | Soft / Hard / Hybrid |
| 5 | ___ | "___" | Yes / No | ___ | Soft / Hard / Hybrid |

**CTA Types:** Soft (subscribe/comment), Hard (buy/sign up), Hybrid (lead magnet)

### Validation

- [ ] **(Critical)** Each CTA is placed AFTER a value peak (not randomly inserted).
- [ ] **(Critical)** All CTAs are brief — under 8 seconds each.
- [ ] **(Critical)** CTAs are specific to the content (not generic "smash that subscribe button").
- [ ] **(Warning)** No more than 3 hard CTAs in a single video (avoids overselling).
- [ ] **(Warning)** First CTA appears after at least 25% of value is delivered (not in the hook).
- [ ] **(Warning)** CTAs feel like natural next steps, not interruptions.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** CTAs are spaced at least 3 minutes apart (not clustered).
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Final CTA is the strongest (most specific, most value-aligned).

**CTA placement score (1-10):** ___

## 3. AWARENESS LEVEL MATCH

### Eugene Schwartz Awareness Stages

- [ ] **(Warning)** For unaware audiences: script spends 80%+ on education, not selling.
- [ ] **(Warning)** For most aware audiences: script includes urgency/scarcity (they already know they want it).
