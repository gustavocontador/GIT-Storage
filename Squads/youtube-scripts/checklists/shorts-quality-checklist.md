## 1. 1-SECOND RULE CHECK

### First Frame Analysis

**First visual frame description:** "_______________________________________________"

- [ ] **(Critical)** First spoken word/sound occurs within 1 second of video start.
- [ ] **(Critical)** Hook creates immediate curiosity or tension within first 3 seconds.
- [ ] **(Warning)** No intro, logo, or setup — script starts mid-action or mid-conflict.
- [ ] **(Warning)** First frame and first words are aligned (visual and audio tell the same story).
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Script drops viewer into peak moment or cliffhanger from second 1.

**First 3 seconds score (1-10):** ___

**Payoff delivery position:** ___ seconds (from script start)

### Validation

- [ ] **(Critical)** Hook and last line were written FIRST, before the middle content.
- [ ] **(Critical)** Last line delivers a payoff, twist, or emotional punch — not a weak CTA or fade.
- [ ] **(Critical)** Hook opens a question/promise that the last line resolves.
- [ ] **(Warning)** Last line reframes the hook — creates a satisfying "full circle" moment.

## 3. REWATCH LOOP CHECK

### Loop Mechanism Analysis

### Validation

- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Ending creates an "oh!" moment that rewards rewatch.

**Rewatch loop score (1-10):** ___

## 6. NO DEAD TIME
