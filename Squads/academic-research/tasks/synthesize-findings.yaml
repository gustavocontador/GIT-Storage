success_criteria:
  - Clear themes identified with supporting evidence
  - Contradictions or conflicts addressed
  - Research gaps identified
  - Synthesis is balanced (not cherry-picking)
  - For meta-analysis: effect sizes calculated

deliverables:
  - Synthesis document (5-10 pages)
  - Summary tables of findings
  - Visual representations (charts, diagrams)
  - Meta-analysis forest plot (if applicable)

synthesis_approaches:
  narrative_synthesis:
    - Group studies by theme or topic
    - Describe findings in text format
    - Identify patterns and contradictions
    - Suitable for mixed study designs

  thematic_synthesis:
    - Code findings from each study
    - Group codes into themes
    - Develop analytical themes
    - Common in qualitative reviews

  meta_analysis:
    - Calculate effect sizes from quantitative studies
    - Pool effect sizes statistically
    - Assess heterogeneity (I² statistic)
    - Create forest plots
    - Only for quantitative studies with comparable outcomes

best_practices:
  - Read extracted data multiple times before synthesizing
  - Look for both agreement and disagreement across studies
  - Consider study quality when interpreting findings
  - Be transparent about limitations of synthesis
  - Use tables/figures to summarize complex findings
  - Cite specific studies when describing findings
  - Identify research gaps explicitly

synthesis_structure_example:
  introduction:
    - Overview of synthesis approach
    - Number of studies included

  main_findings:
    - Theme 1: [Description with supporting studies]
    - Theme 2: [Description with supporting studies]
    - Theme 3: [Description with supporting studies]

  contradictions:
    - Conflicting findings and possible explanations

  gaps:
    - What is NOT known or under-researched

  limitations:
    - Quality issues, publication bias, heterogeneity

common_pitfalls:
  - Cherry-picking studies that support your hypothesis
  - Ignoring contradictory findings
  - Not considering study quality in synthesis
  - Over-interpreting findings from limited studies
  - Not identifying research gaps
