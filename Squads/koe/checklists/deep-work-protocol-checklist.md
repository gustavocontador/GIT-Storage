## 1. Session Setup

```yaml
session_setup:
  time_block:
    - [ ] Session duration is 2-4 hours (minimum 2h, maximum 4h)
    - [ ] Start time and end time defined before beginning
    - [ ] Session scheduled during peak cognitive hours (know your chronotype)
    - [ ] No meetings, calls, or commitments during the block
  environment:
    - [ ] Phone on airplane mode or in another room
    - [ ] Notifications disabled on all devices
    - [ ] Browser tabs closed (only project-relevant tabs open)
    - [ ] Physical workspace cleared of distractions
    - [ ] "Do not disturb" signal visible to others (closed door, sign, status)
```

---

## 2. Single Big Idea Focus

```yaml
single_focus:
  commitment:
    - [ ] ONE Big Idea selected as the focus for the entire session
    - [ ] Big Idea written on paper or pinned on screen as anchor
    - [ ] All materials related to this Big Idea pre-gathered
    - [ ] No switching to another idea during the session
  scope_definition:
    - [ ] Specific deliverable defined (draft, outline, script, framework)
    - [ ] "Done" criteria established before starting
    - [ ] Deliverable is achievable within the session length
    - [ ] Stretch goal identified (if flow state hits)
```

---

## 3. No Interruptions Protocol

```yaml
no_interruptions:
  digital:
    - [ ] Email closed entirely (not minimized)
    - [ ] Slack/Discord/messaging closed
    - [ ] Social media blocked or inaccessible
    - [ ] Only tools needed for the work are open
  physical:
    - [ ] Household/office informed of deep work block
    - [ ] Emergency contact method designated (so non-emergencies are filtered)
    - [ ] Snacks/water/coffee prepared before starting
    - [ ] Bathroom break taken before starting
  mental:
    - [ ] Open loops captured to queue BEFORE session (brain dump)
    - [ ] Anxiety-producing tasks noted and deferred explicitly
    - [ ] Intention set: "For the next X hours, only this matters"
```

---

## 4. Output Standards

```yaml
output_standards:
  minimum_viable_output:
    - [ ] Newsletter: minimum 1000 words of draft
    - [ ] YouTube script: minimum full outline + opening written
    - [ ] Course module: minimum complete framework + 3 examples
    - [ ] Thread: minimum 10 tweets drafted
  quality_markers:
    - [ ] Output uses APAG structure (or relevant framework)
    - [ ] Output contains at least 1 original insight
    - [ ] Output is "shippable" with 1 more editing pass
    - [ ] Output advances a Big Idea toward publication
```

---

## 5. Session Execution

```yaml
execution:
  warm_up:
    - [ ] First 10 minutes: re-read previous work or outline to enter context
    - [ ] No pressure to produce during warm-up
    - [ ] Resistance acknowledged and pushed through (do not stop at first discomfort)
  flow_maintenance:
    - [ ] Work in 25-50 minute sprints if needed (Pomodoro optional)
    - [ ] Breaks are physical (stand, stretch) not digital (no phone)
    - [ ] Track when flow state activates (time, conditions) for pattern recognition
    - [ ] If stuck, switch to a different section of the same Big Idea (not a new topic)
  wind_down:
    - [ ] Last 10 minutes: capture "where I left off" notes for next session
    - [ ] Key decisions or breakthroughs documented
    - [ ] Next session's starting point identified
```

---

## 6. Post-Session Review

```yaml
post_session:
  measurement:
    - [ ] Session duration logged (actual vs planned)
    - [ ] Output volume logged (words, slides, minutes of script)
    - [ ] Interruption count logged (zero is the goal)
    - [ ] Flow state achieved? (yes/no + duration estimate)
  improvement:
    - [ ] What worked well this session?
    - [ ] What was the biggest distraction?
    - [ ] What would I change for next session?
    - [ ] Session data added to weekly review for pattern analysis
```

## Scoring

| Category | Items | Points Each | Max |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----|
| Critical — No Interruptions & Single Focus | 13 | 3 | 39 |
| Standard — Setup, Output & Execution | 15 | 2 | 30 |
| Bonus — Post-Session Review | 8 | 1 | 8 |
| **TOTAL** | **36** | | **77** |

### Thresholds
- **PASS**: >= 62 points (80%)
- **CONDITIONAL**: >= 46 points (60%)
- **FAIL**: < 46 points

### If FAIL
1. Reduce session to 2 hours — mastery comes before endurance
2. Phone in another room (not just on silent — physical separation)
3. Write your ONE Big Idea on a sticky note and put it on your monitor
4. If output falls below minimum, diagnose: was it interruptions, unclear scope, or lack of preparation?
