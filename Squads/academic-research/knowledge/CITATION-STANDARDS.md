## 3. Reference Management Tools

| Tool | Best For | Integration | Cost |
|------|----------|-------------|------|
| **Zotero** | General use, browser integration | Word, Google Docs, LaTeX | Free (open-source) |
| **Mendeley** | PDF annotation, social features | Word, LaTeX | Free (Elsevier) |
| **EndNote** | Institutional use, advanced features | Word | Paid |
| **BibTeX/BibLaTeX** | LaTeX users | LaTeX/Overleaf | Free |
| **Paperpile** | Google Docs users | Google Docs, Word | Paid |

### Best Practices
- **ALWAYS** use a reference manager (never format manually)
- Import references via DOI or ISBN when possible (fewer errors)
- Check imported data (auto-import can miss details)
- Back up your library regularly
- Use folders/tags to organize by project
- Sync across devices (Zotero Sync, Mendeley Cloud)

## 4. Plagiarism Prevention

### Types of Plagiarism

| Type | Description | Severity |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Direct copying | Verbatim text without quotes/citation | Critical |
| Inadequate paraphrasing | Too close to original wording | High |
| Missing attribution | Ideas used without citation | High |
| Self-plagiarism | Recycling own text without citation | Medium |
| Mosaic plagiarism | Patchwork of sources without proper citation | High |
| Accidental | Forgot to cite, lost track of source | Medium |

### Prevention Protocol

1. **Cite as you write** — Don't wait until the end
2. **Use quotation marks** for any direct text (and cite)
3. **Paraphrase properly** — Change structure AND wording, then cite
4. **Track all sources** — Add to reference manager immediately
5. **Run Turnitin/iThenticate** before submission

### Similarity Score Thresholds

| Score | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 0-10% | Acceptable | Review flagged passages |
| 10-15% | Borderline | Review and rephrase if needed |
| 15-25% | Concerning | Significant revision needed |
| 25%+ | Unacceptable | Major rewrite required |

**Note:** Exclude references, quotations, and bibliographic data from similarity check.

## 5. Citation Best Practices

### DO
- Include DOI for all sources that have one
- Use "et al." correctly per style guide
- Cite primary sources (not secondary when avoidable)
- Include page numbers for direct quotes
- Keep reference list alphabetical (APA, MLA, Harvard) or numbered (Vancouver, IEEE)
- Cite recent sources preferentially (last 5 years)
- Balance citation sources (don't over-cite one author)

### DON'T
- Cite sources you haven't read (cite the secondary source if needed)
- Use Wikipedia as an academic source (use it to find primary sources)
- Mix citation styles in one paper
- Include sources in reference list that aren't cited in text (and vice versa)
- Over-quote (paraphrasing shows understanding)
- Use "(ibid.)" in APA (it's a Chicago convention)

| Error | Example | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|

| No DOI | Journal article without doi | Add https://doi.org/10.xxxx |
| Inconsistent names | "Smith, J." then "Smith, John" | Use consistent format |
| Missing page numbers | "Smith states..." without page | Add (Smith, 2024, p. 45) for quotes |
| Orphan citations | Cited but not in reference list | Ensure 1:1 match |
| Ghost references | In reference list but not cited | Remove or cite |
