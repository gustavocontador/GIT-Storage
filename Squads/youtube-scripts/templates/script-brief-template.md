Priority: [ ] Standard  [ ] Rush

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[1] VIDEO CONCEPT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Working Title *:

  → Write a title that would make YOU click. This is a working title;
    the final title will be refined during creation. Aim for curiosity
    + specificity. Example: "I Tried the $1 vs $1,000 Camera — the
    Result Shocked Me"

Thumbnail Concept:

  → Describe the thumbnail in 1-2 sentences. What is the dominant
    image? What text overlay (if any)? What emotion does the face
    convey? Strong thumbnails pair with the title to create a
    "curiosity gap" — the title asks the question, the thumbnail
    hints at the answer.

Core Promise (1 sentence) *:

  → What will the viewer GET from watching this video? Be specific.
    Bad: "Learn about investing." Good: "Walk away with a 3-step
    system to invest your first $1,000 without losing sleep."

Target Length *: [ ] 5-7 min  [ ] 8-12 min  [ ] 15+ min  [ ] Short (~34s)

  → Choose based on the depth of content and your channel's historical
    AVD (Average View Duration). If unsure, 8-12 min is the safest
    default for most niches.

Format *: [ ] Tutorial  [ ] Listicle  [ ] Story  [ ] Commentary
          [ ] Documentary  [ ] Challenge  [ ] Reaction  [ ] Comparison

  → The format determines which specialist agent handles your script
    and which structural framework is applied.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[2] AUDIENCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Who is watching *:

  → Be specific. Not "everyone interested in finance" but "25-35 year
    old professionals who just started earning $60K+ and feel behind
    on saving." The more precise you are, the sharper the hook.

What they already know:

  → What baseline knowledge can you assume? This prevents the script
    from over-explaining basics (boring) or skipping context (confusing).
    Example: "They know what an index fund is but have never bought one."

What they want to learn/feel *:

  → Every viewer has a functional goal (learn X, solve Y) AND an
    emotional goal (feel confident, feel entertained, feel validated).
    Name both. Example: "Learn how to start investing (functional).
    Feel like they're finally in control of their money (emotional)."

Awareness Level *:
  [ ] Unaware        — They don't know the problem exists
  [ ] Problem-Aware  — They know the problem but not the solution
  [ ] Solution-Aware — They know solutions exist but not yours
  [ ] Product-Aware  — They know your solution but haven't acted
  [ ] Most Aware     — They know you and need a final push

  → This level determines how the hook is framed. Unaware audiences
    need education hooks; Most Aware audiences need urgency hooks.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[3] NICHE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Primary Niche *:
  [ ] Finance  [ ] Tech  [ ] Education  [ ] True Crime
  [ ] Motivation  [ ] Lifestyle  [ ] Health/Fitness
  [ ] Gaming  [ ] Science  [ ] Business  [ ] Other: ____________

Sub-Niche:

  → Example: Primary = Finance, Sub-Niche = Crypto Tax Strategy.
    The sub-niche activates niche-specific benchmarks and language
    patterns from the niche-adapter.

Competitor Videos to Reference:

  → Paste 1-3 YouTube URLs of similar videos that performed well.
    These will be analyzed for structure, pacing, and hook strategy.
    1.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[4] HOOK STRATEGY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Hook Type *:
  [ ] PVSS (Proof-Value-Structure-Stakes)
  [ ] TTS  (Target-Transformation-Stakes)
  [ ] Cold Open: Flash-Forward
  [ ] Cold Open: Provocative Statement
  [ ] Cold Open: Mid-Action Drop
  [ ] Cold Open: Confession
  [ ] Cold Open: Unanswered Question
  [ ] Let the specialist decide

  → See hook-template.md for detailed examples of each type.
    If you're unsure, "Let the specialist decide" is a valid choice;
    the assigned specialist will pick based on niche best practices.

Opening Line Draft:

  → Write your best attempt at the first sentence. Even a rough draft
    gives the specialist something to riff on. If blank, leave as
    "N/A — specialist to draft."

Visual for First 5 Seconds:

  → What does the viewer SEE in the first 5 seconds? For faceless
    channels: describe the B-roll, animation, or text. For face-to-cam:
    describe the framing, expression, and setting.

Promise Delivered by Second 15:

  → By the 15-second mark, the viewer must know exactly what they'll
    get from the video. Describe what that payoff preview looks like.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[5] STRUCTURE PREFERENCES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Script Type *:
  [ ] Full word-for-word script
  [ ] Outline with detailed bullet points
  [ ] Hybrid (word-for-word hook + outline body)

  → Word-for-word is best for faceless/narrated channels.
    Outline is best for experienced on-camera creators who ad-lib.
    Hybrid splits the difference.

Key Points to Cover (3-7) *:

  → List the main beats the video must hit. Order matters — put them
    in the sequence you want them presented. These become the backbone
    of the script structure.
  1.
  2.
  3.
  4.
  5.
  6.
  7.

Must-Include Data/Facts:

  → Specific statistics, quotes, dates, or figures that MUST appear in
    the script. Provide sources where possible. Example: "Include the
    stat that 78% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck (Forbes 2024)."

Stories or Examples to Use:

  → Personal anecdotes, case studies, hypothetical scenarios, or
    analogies you want woven into the script. Stories are the #1
    retention tool — the more specific, the better.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[6] RETENTION MECHANICS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Open Loops to Plant:

  → Open loops are promises made early that are resolved later.
    They keep viewers watching. Example: "I'll tell you the one
    mistake that cost me $50,000 — but first, you need to understand
    this..." List 1-3 open loops you want embedded.
  1.
  2.
  3.

Planned Pattern Interrupts:

  → Pattern interrupts break monotony and reset attention. Examples:
    visual change, tone shift, unexpected question, humor beat,
    on-screen text. Aim for 1 every 60-90 seconds. List any specific
    ones you want included.

Stakes to Escalate:

  → Stakes are what the viewer LOSES by not watching. They should
    escalate throughout the video. Example progression:
    Early: "You might be wasting money..."
    Mid: "This mistake costs the average person $12,000/year..."
    Late: "If you ignore this, you could lose your entire portfolio..."

Golden Thread:

  → The single thematic thread that ties the entire video together.
    Every section should connect back to this thread. Example:
    "The financial system is designed to keep you broke — but
    there's a loophole."


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[7] EMOTIONAL ARC
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  → Map the emotional journey you want the viewer to experience.
    Strong scripts ride an emotional wave, not a flat line.

Opening Emotion:    ____________  (e.g., curiosity, shock, fear)
Mid-Point Emotion:  ____________  (e.g., tension, empathy, surprise)
Climax Emotion:     ____________  (e.g., excitement, outrage, awe)
Closing Emotion:    ____________  (e.g., empowerment, hope, urgency)


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[8] CTA STRATEGY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Primary CTA *:

  → The single most important action you want the viewer to take.
    Be specific: "Subscribe" is weak. "Subscribe so you don't miss
    Part 2 where I reveal the advanced strategy" is strong.

CTA Placement:
  [ ] Embedded mid-video (natural integration)
  [ ] End of video
  [ ] Both mid + end
  [ ] Multiple micro-CTAs throughout

Secondary CTA:

  → Optional second action: comment prompt, check description,
    watch another video, visit a link, etc.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[9] PRODUCTION NOTES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  → These notes guide the specialist in tailoring the script to your
    production style, especially critical for faceless channels.

Narration Style:
  [ ] Conversational   — Like talking to a friend
  [ ] Authoritative    — Expert delivering knowledge
  [ ] Storytelling     — Narrative-driven, cinematic
  [ ] Fast-Paced       — High energy, quick cuts
  [ ] Calm/Meditative  — Slow, deliberate, ASMR-adjacent

B-Roll Themes:

  → Describe the visual world of the video. Examples: "city skylines,
    stock tickers, luxury lifestyle shots" or "cozy desk setup,
    screen recordings, handwritten notes."

Music Mood:

  → Describe the music vibe, not specific tracks. Examples: "lo-fi
    chill for tutorial sections, cinematic tension for story beats,
    uplifting electronic for the conclusion."

Text Overlay Style:

  → How should key points appear on screen? Examples: "bold white
    text with subtle animation," "handwritten style," "minimal —
    only for stats and key terms."

Face on Camera: [ ] Yes  [ ] No (faceless)  [ ] Mixed


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[10] QUALITY TARGETS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Target Retention:
  [ ] 23.7% (average — baseline)
  [ ] 40%+  (good — strong script)
  [ ] 50%+  (excellent — top-tier script)

Target Hook Strength (1-10):     ____

  → Rate how strong the first 30 seconds need to be. A "10" means
    this video lives or dies on the hook (e.g., competitive niche
    with high bounce rates). A "6" means a decent hook with strong
    mid-video content is acceptable.

Readability Level:
  [ ] 5th grade   — Simple, universal (best for broad audiences)
  [ ] 8th grade   — Moderate complexity (good for educated niches)
  [ ] Professional — Technical vocabulary acceptable (expert audience)

  → Lower readability = higher retention for most niches.
    5th grade is recommended unless your audience expects expertise.

## Notes for the Script Chief

When receiving a completed brief:

1. **Validate completeness** -- Check the submission checklist. If required fields are missing, return to the submitter with specific questions before routing.

2. **Determine routing** -- Based on Format and Niche, route to the appropriate specialist agent. If the brief includes an existing script for revision, route through the Script Analyst first.

3. **Set quality expectations** -- Use the Quality Targets section to calibrate the scorer's thresholds for this specific script.

4. **Flag ambiguity** -- If any section is vague or contradictory (e.g., "conversational tone" + "professional readability"), flag it for clarification before proceeding.

5. **Attach brief ID** -- Assign a unique brief ID in the format `YSB-YYYY-NNN` (e.g., `YSB-2025-042`) for tracking through the pipeline.
