# ============================================================================
# Squad Creator Model Routing Configuration
# ============================================================================
# Self-contained config for task-to-model routing.
# Squad Chief consults this before executing tasks to optimize token costs.
#
# PHILOSOPHY: "Use the cheapest model that maintains quality"
# - Haiku: Deterministic tasks (validation, scoring, admin)
# - Sonnet: Moderate analysis (documentation, templates)
# - Opus: Complex reasoning (DNA extraction, agent creation)
#
# Based on empirical analysis: docs/enhance/squad_creator_token_economy/
# Expected savings: 60-70% of token consumption (validated)
# ============================================================================

# ============================================================================
# FALLBACK CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
# If a model fails, try the next tier up

fallback:
  haiku:
    on_failure: sonnet
    on_quality_below: 0.85

  sonnet:
    on_failure: opus
    on_quality_below: 0.80

# ============================================================================
# USAGE BY SQUAD CHIEF
# ============================================================================
#
# Before executing a task, Squad Chief should:
#
# 1. Look up task in this config:
#    task_config = model_routing.tasks[task_name]
#
# 2. Get the tier:
#    tier = task_config.tier  # haiku, sonnet, or opus
#
# 3. Spawn agent with model:
#    Task(
#      subagent_type: "appropriate-agent",
#      model: tier,  # "haiku", "sonnet", or "opus"
#      prompt: "..."
#    )
#
# 4. If quality check fails, use fallback:
#    if quality < fallback[tier].on_quality_below:
#        retry with fallback[tier].on_failure
#
# ============================================================================

# METRICS TRACKING
