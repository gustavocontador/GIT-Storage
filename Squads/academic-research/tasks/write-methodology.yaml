methodology_structure: |
  # Methods

  ## Study Design
  [Experimental, survey, case study, ethnography, etc.]
  [Justification for choice]

  ## Participants
  [N, demographics, inclusion/exclusion criteria]
  [Sampling method, recruitment procedures]
  [Response rate, attrition]

  ## Materials/Instruments
  [Surveys, equipment, software used]
  [Validity, reliability of instruments]
  [Pilot testing results]

  ## Procedures
  [Step-by-step what you did]
  [Timing, duration, conditions]
  [Any randomization or counterbalancing]

  ## Data Analysis
  [Statistical tests or qualitative coding methods]
  [Software used (SPSS, R, NVivo, etc.)]
  [How missing data was handled]

  ## Ethical Considerations
  [IRB approval number]
  [Informed consent procedures]
  [Data privacy and storage]

quantitative_specifics:
  - Sample size calculation (power analysis)
  - Randomization procedures
  - Control conditions
  - Statistical tests used
  - Alpha level (e.g., p < .05)
  - Effect size measures

qualitative_specifics:
  - Sampling rationale (purposive, theoretical)
  - Data saturation
  - Coding procedures (open, axial, selective)
  - Inter-coder reliability
  - Reflexivity/positionality statement

best_practices:
  - Use past tense ("Participants completed...")
  - Be specific (exact timing, N, procedures)
  - Justify methodological choices
  - Describe what you ACTUALLY did (not what you planned)
  - Include enough detail for replication
  - Cite instruments/procedures from literature

common_pitfalls:
  - Vague descriptions ("data was collected")
  - Missing details (can't replicate)
  - Not justifying methodological choices
  - Mixing methods and results sections
  - No mention of ethics approval
