# Repurpose Content

```yaml
id: repurpose-content
execution_type: Agent
purpose: Systematically repurpose a single source content piece into platform-specific variations using the 1-to-54 framework, mapping each piece to the 9 Content Pillars for maximum coverage.
executor: @vanessa-lau
inputs:
  - Source content piece (video, post, newsletter, or podcast)
  - Platform distribution plan (which platforms are active)
  - 9 Content Pillars mapping for Tiago's brand
  - Content calendar with open slots
preconditions:
  - Source content is finalized and published (or ready)
  - Platform accounts are active
  - Content pillars are defined
steps:
  1. Deconstruct the source content:
     - Extract the core message (1 sentence)
     - List all sub-topics mentioned
     - Pull out quotable lines (3-5)
     - Identify story elements
     - Note any data points, stats, or proof elements
     - Save visual moments (if video: timestamps of key frames)
  2. Map extracted elements to 9 Content Pillars:
     - Pillar 1: Educational (teach something)
     - Pillar 2: Inspirational (motivate action)
     - Pillar 3: Personal (behind the scenes, vulnerability)
     - Pillar 4: Promotional (Next Step, services)
     - Pillar 5: Community (questions, polls, engagement)
     - Pillar 6: Entertainment (humor, relatable moments)
     - Pillar 7: Storytelling (narratives, client journeys)
     - Pillar 8: Tactical (step-by-step, how-to)
     - Pillar 9: Contrarian (challenge norms, hot takes)
  3. Create platform-specific versions:
     - Instagram Feed: 1 carousel (key insights as slides)
     - Instagram Reels: 2-3 short clips (different hooks, same content)
     - Instagram Stories: 5-slide sequence (poll, insight, CTA)
     - YouTube Shorts: 2 clips (best 60s moments)
     - YouTube Long-form: Behind-the-scenes or expanded version
     - TikTok: 3 variations (raw cuts with different hooks)
     - LinkedIn: 1 text post (professional angle)
     - Twitter/X: 1 thread (5-7 tweets) + 2 standalone tweets
     - Substack: Deep-dive newsletter on the topic
  4. Adapt format and tone per platform:
     - Instagram: Visual-first, short captions, trending audio for Reels
     - YouTube: Thumbnail-worthy moments, structured
     - TikTok: Raw, unfiltered, pattern-interrupt style
     - LinkedIn: Professional context, longer text, no hashtag spam
     - Twitter/X: Punchy, tweetable insights, thread-friendly
     - Substack: Intimate, personal, depth over breadth
  5. Create the repurposing map (visual):
     - Source piece in center
     - Branches to each platform
     - Each branch shows: format, content pillar, publish date
  6. Write all pieces (or outline for longer formats)
  7. Schedule across the week (spread, don't cluster)
outputs:
  - Repurposing map (source → all derivatives)
  - All content pieces written or outlined:
    - Platform, format, content pillar tag
    - Full text or outline
    - Scheduled date
  - Total piece count (target: 15-25 from 1 source)
validation:
  - At least 15 unique pieces created from 1 source
  - No copy-paste between platforms (each is adapted)
  - At least 5 of the 9 Content Pillars represented
  - Each piece has a platform-native hook
  - Spread across minimum 5 days (not all same day)
  - At least 1 piece per active platform
  - Voice consistency maintained across all pieces
