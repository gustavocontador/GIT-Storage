success_criteria:
  - Follows PRISMA 2020 guidelines (27-item checklist)
  - Clear protocol with pre-defined criteria
  - Transparent reporting of search and screening
  - Quality assessment of included studies
  - PRISMA flow diagram included
  - Synthesis is balanced and evidence-based

deliverables:
  - Systematic review manuscript
  - PRISMA flow diagram
  - PRISMA checklist (completed)
  - Supplementary materials (search strings, extraction form, quality assessment)

prisma_structure:
  title:
    - Identify as systematic review in title

  abstract:
    - Structured abstract (objectives, methods, results, conclusions)

  introduction:
    - Rationale and objectives

  methods:
    - Protocol and registration (PROSPERO)
    - Eligibility criteria
    - Information sources (databases)
    - Search strategy (full search strings in appendix)
    - Selection process (screening levels)
    - Data collection process (extraction variables)
    - Data items (what was extracted)
    - Study risk of bias assessment
    - Synthesis methods

  results:
    - Study selection (PRISMA flow diagram)
    - Study characteristics (table)
    - Risk of bias assessment results
    - Results of syntheses (narrative or meta-analysis)

  discussion:
    - Summary of findings
    - Limitations
    - Implications

  funding:
    - Funding sources and conflicts of interest

best_practices:
  - Pre-register protocol on PROSPERO before starting
  - Use PRISMA 2020 checklist throughout writing
  - Report all steps transparently (can be replicated)
  - Include full search strings in appendix
  - Report reasons for exclusion at full-text stage
  - Use ROBIS tool for assessing risk of bias
  - Upload protocol and data extraction form as supplementary materials

common_pitfalls:
  - Not pre-registering protocol (can appear like p-hacking)
  - Missing items from PRISMA checklist
  - Not reporting search strategy in enough detail
  - Cherry-picking studies
  - Not assessing study quality/risk of bias
  - Incomplete PRISMA flow diagram
