## 1. Foundation Piece

```yaml
foundation:
  big_idea_anchor:
    - [ ] Content cascade starts from a single validated Big Idea
    - [ ] Big Idea has passed Big Idea Generation Checklist
    - [ ] Big Idea has named framework
    - [ ] Foundation piece is the long-form version (newsletter, YouTube, course module)
  depth:
    - [ ] Foundation piece contains full Iceberg depth
    - [ ] Foundation piece uses APAG structure
    - [ ] Foundation piece is the "master" from which all derivatives come
    - [ ] Foundation piece is 1500+ words or 10+ minutes of video
```

---

## 2. Cascade Decomposition

```yaml
decomposition:
  extraction:
    - [ ] Minimum 5 standalone sub-ideas extracted from foundation
    - [ ] Each sub-idea has its own hook
    - [ ] Each sub-idea delivers value independently (no "Part 1 of 7" dependency)
    - [ ] Sub-ideas cover different angles: theory, practice, story, data, objection
  target_volume:
    - [ ] 1 Big Idea produces minimum 10 content pieces
    - [ ] Stretch target: 20+ pieces from a single Big Idea
    - [ ] Each piece is genuinely different (not just reformatted)
    - [ ] Volume does NOT sacrifice quality per piece
```

---

## 3. Platform Adaptation

```yaml
platform_adaptation:
  format_matrix:
    - [ ] Long-form newsletter version created
    - [ ] YouTube video script derived
    - [ ] Twitter/X thread version created
    - [ ] Short-form video (Reels/Shorts/TikTok) clips planned
    - [ ] Instagram carousel or static post version created
  platform_native:
    - [ ] Each piece optimized for its platform (not just copy-pasted)
    - [ ] Platform-specific hooks used (what works on Twitter differs from YouTube)
    - [ ] Platform character/length limits respected
    - [ ] Platform-specific CTAs included
```

---

## 4. Leverage Ratio

```yaml
leverage_ratio:
  measurement:
    - [ ] Input time tracked (hours spent on foundation piece)
    - [ ] Output count tracked (total derivative pieces)
    - [ ] Leverage ratio calculated: output pieces / input hours
    - [ ] Target leverage ratio: minimum 5:1 (5 pieces per hour of foundation work)
  optimization:
    - [ ] Templates used for derivative creation (reduce per-piece time)
    - [ ] Batch processing of derivatives (all tweets at once, all shorts at once)
    - [ ] Repurposing workflow documented and repeatable
    - [ ] Time per derivative piece trending downward over months
```

---

## 5. Cascade Calendar

```yaml
cascade_calendar:
  scheduling:
    - [ ] Derivatives scheduled across 1-4 weeks (not all published at once)
    - [ ] Platform-specific posting times used
    - [ ] Content mix maintained (not 20 tweets about the same idea in one day)
    - [ ] Foundation piece published first, derivatives follow
  recycling:
    - [ ] Top-performing derivatives flagged for re-use in 30-90 days
    - [ ] Evergreen content identified and scheduled for periodic re-posting
    - [ ] Seasonal relevance considered for scheduling
```

---

## 6. Quality Gate

```yaml
quality_gate:
  per_piece_check:
    - [ ] Every derivative piece has its own hook (not just the foundation hook)
    - [ ] Every derivative piece delivers at least one insight
    - [ ] No piece feels like "filler" or padding
    - [ ] Each piece could attract a new follower on its own
  cascade_check:
    - [ ] VETO if fewer than 10 pieces derived from foundation
    - [ ] VETO if derivatives are just reformatted copies (no adaptation)
    - [ ] VETO if no platform-specific optimization applied
    - [ ] VETO if leverage ratio below 3:1
```

## Scoring

| Category | Items | Points Each | Max |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----|
| Critical — Foundation & Decomposition | 12 | 3 | 36 |
| Standard — Platform Adaptation & Leverage | 12 | 2 | 24 |
| Bonus — Calendar & Quality Gate | 11 | 1 | 11 |
| **TOTAL** | **35** | | **71** |

### Thresholds
- **PASS**: >= 57 points (80%)
- **CONDITIONAL**: >= 43 points (60%)
- **FAIL**: < 43 points

### If FAIL
1. Go back to foundation: if the Big Idea is weak, the cascade will be weak
2. Extract sub-ideas by asking: "What are 5 things someone needs to understand to get this Big Idea?"
3. For each sub-idea, write a tweet. If the tweet has no hook, the sub-idea needs sharpening.
4. Batch your cascade: block 2 hours to create ALL derivatives at once (not one per day)
