## 1. Named Framework

```yaml
named_framework:
  naming:
    - [ ] Big Idea has a proprietary name (not generic description)
    - [ ] Name is 2-4 words maximum
    - [ ] Name is memorable and repeatable (passes the "tell a friend" test)
    - [ ] Name suggests the benefit or mechanism without explanation
  uniqueness:
    - [ ] Name does not conflict with existing well-known frameworks
    - [ ] A search for the name does not return competing definitions
    - [ ] Name creates a sense of ownership and authority
    - [ ] Name can become a hashtag, course title, or book chapter
```

## 2. Iceberg Depth

```yaml
iceberg_depth:
  surface:
    - [ ] Big Idea expressible in one sentence (surface layer)
    - [ ] Surface layer is simple enough for casual social media audience
    - [ ] Surface creates immediate curiosity ("tell me more")
  depth:
    - [ ] Minimum 3 supporting sources/evidence points
    - [ ] Depth explains the mechanism (HOW and WHY it works)
    - [ ] Depth includes real-world examples or case studies
    - [ ] Depth sufficient to fill a 10-minute YouTube video or 1500-word essay
```

## 3. Contrarian Angle

```yaml
contrarian:
  opposition:
    - [ ] Big Idea challenges a common belief or conventional wisdom
    - [ ] The "common belief" is clearly stated (what most people think)
    - [ ] The contrarian position is clearly stated (what you argue instead)
    - [ ] The gap between common belief and contrarian position creates tension
  credibility:
    - [ ] Contrarian position backed by evidence (not just opinion)
    - [ ] Position is genuinely held (not manufactured for engagement)
    - [ ] Position can withstand public debate
    - [ ] Position evolves your audience's thinking (not just triggers them)
```

---

## 4. APAG Readiness

```yaml
apag_ready:
  attention:
    - [ ] Big Idea has a natural hook for the Attention phase
    - [ ] The hook can be derived directly from the contrarian angle
  perspective:
    - [ ] Big Idea shifts the reader's perspective on a familiar topic
    - [ ] The perspective shift is clear and articulable
  advantage:
    - [ ] Big Idea gives the reader a tangible advantage or insight
    - [ ] Advantage is specific (not vague "think differently")
  gamify:
    - [ ] Big Idea inspires a specific next action
    - [ ] Action is achievable and produces a measurable result
    - [ ] Reader can start applying within 24 hours
```

## 5. Content Cascade Potential

```yaml
cascade_potential:
  decomposability:
    - [ ] Big Idea can be broken into 5+ sub-ideas
    - [ ] Each sub-idea is valuable standalone
    - [ ] Sub-ideas cover different facets (theory, practice, examples, objections)
    - [ ] One Big Idea can generate 20+ content pieces across formats
  format_versatility:
    - [ ] Works as a tweet thread
    - [ ] Works as a newsletter deep-dive
    - [ ] Works as a YouTube video
    - [ ] Works as a course module or workshop segment
```

---

## 6. Validation Gate

```yaml
validation:
  essential_tests:
    - [ ] Passes "So what?" test — audience cares about this topic
    - [ ] Passes "Says who?" test — credible evidence supports it
    - [ ] Passes "One sentence" test — can be summarized clearly
    - [ ] Passes "Contrarian" test — challenges status quo meaningfully
  red_flags:
    - [ ] VETO if idea cannot be named in 4 words or fewer
    - [ ] VETO if idea agrees with conventional wisdom (not contrarian)
    - [ ] VETO if idea has no actionable takeaway
    - [ ] VETO if idea requires 5+ minutes just to explain the surface
```

## Scoring

| Category | Items | Points Each | Max |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----|
| Critical — Named Framework & Contrarian Angle | 12 | 3 | 36 |
| Standard — Iceberg Depth & APAG Readiness | 12 | 2 | 24 |
| Bonus — Cascade Potential & Validation | 12 | 1 | 12 |
| **TOTAL** | **36** | | **72** |

### Thresholds
- **PASS**: >= 58 points (80%)
- **CONDITIONAL**: >= 43 points (60%)
- **FAIL**: < 43 points

### If FAIL
1. Name it: force a 2-4 word name RIGHT NOW — even a bad name is better than no name
2. State the contrarian position: "Most people think X. I argue Y because Z."
3. Find 3 sources that support your contrarian position
4. Write one tweet that communicates the Big Idea — if you cannot, the idea is not clear enough
