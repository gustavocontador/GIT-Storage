# Triangulation Checklist (Layers 5-8)

## Pre-Triangulation
- [ ] Claim clearly stated (specific, falsifiable)
- [ ] Target layer identified (5, 6, 7, or 8)
- [ ] Minimum 3 independent sources identified
- [ ] Sources are from different categories (not 3 from same course)

## Source Evaluation
For each source used:

### Source 1
- [ ] Source path documented
- [ ] Source tier identified (1/2/3)
- [ ] Relevant excerpt quoted
- [ ] Evidence type: direct (explicit) or indirect (inferred)

### Source 2

## Triangulation Assessment
- [ ] Sources agree on core claim
- [ ] Contradictions documented (if any)
- [ ] Contradictions resolved or flagged for elicitation
- [ ] Confidence assigned:
  - [ ] Alta (3+ sources agree, at least 1 Tier 1)
  - [ ] Media (2 sources agree, or 3 agree but all Tier 3)
  - [ ] Baixa (1 source + inference — FLAG for elicitation)

## Post-Triangulation
- [ ] Claim added to layer artifact with evidence
- [ ] Cross-references created to supporting chunks
- [ ] Gaps flagged for subject elicitation (if Baixa confidence)
- [ ] Human checkpoint requested (if layer 6, 7, or 8)
