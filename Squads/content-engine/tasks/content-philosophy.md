# Content Philosophy

```yaml
id: content-philosophy
execution_type: Agent
purpose: Define Tiago's content philosophy, Domain of Mastery, and topic pillars that align personal expertise with audience needs, creating a focused content funnel from awareness to Next Step.
executor: @dan-koe
inputs:
  - Tiago's expertise areas and professional background
  - Target audience profile (professional who had results but is stuck)
  - Brand positioning ("Clareza em meio ao caos")
  - Service offering (Next Step — beta gratuito)
preconditions:
  - Brand audit completed or brand positioning clearly defined
  - Understanding of Tiago's personal journey and transformation
steps:
  1. Identify Domain of Mastery intersections:
     - Circle 1: What Tiago is deeply skilled at
     - Circle 2: What Tiago is genuinely curious about
     - Circle 3: What the audience desperately needs
     - Sweet spot: Where all three overlap
  2. Define the One-Person Business Model alignment:
     - Content → attracts the right audience
     - Product (Next Step) → solves the core problem
     - Philosophy → differentiates from every other "coach"
  3. Select 3 content pillars from Domain of Mastery:
     - Pillar 1: Problem-aware (expose "obesidade mental" symptoms)
     - Pillar 2: Solution-aware (show what clarity looks like in practice)
     - Pillar 3: Mechanism-aware (why Next Step works)
  4. Map pillars to audience journey stages:
     - Cold: "I feel stuck but don't know why" → Pillar 1
     - Warm: "I need clarity, show me how" → Pillar 2
     - Hot: "I want help, what's the next step?" → Pillar 3
  5. Apply Art of Focus:
     - Define what Tiago will NOT talk about (exclusion list)
     - Define the single thesis every piece reinforces
     - Set the "broken record" message that repeats
  6. Define content funnel:
     - Top: High-reach content (reels, shorts, hot takes)
     - Middle: Trust-building content (threads, carousels, newsletters)
     - Bottom: Conversion content (testimonials, behind-scenes, direct CTA)
  7. Write the Content Philosophy Statement (2-3 paragraphs)
outputs:
  - Content Philosophy document with:
    - Domain of Mastery diagram (3 circles + sweet spot)
    - 3 content pillars with descriptions
    - Audience journey map (cold → warm → hot)
    - Exclusion list (topics to avoid)
    - Content funnel structure
    - Philosophy statement
validation:
  - All 3 pillars clearly connect to "Clareza em meio ao caos" thesis
  - Audience journey has specific content examples per stage
  - Exclusion list has at least 5 items
  - Philosophy statement is concise and sounds like Tiago (direto, sem verniz)
  - Content funnel has clear path from awareness to Next Step
