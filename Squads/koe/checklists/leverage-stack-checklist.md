  creation_system:
    - [ ] Repeatable content creation process documented
    - [ ] Source content → derivative content pipeline active

## 5. Reinforcement & Flywheel Effect

## Scoring

| Category | Items | Points Each | Max |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----|
| Critical — Brand Trust Layer | 10 | 3 | 30 |
| Critical — Digital Products Layer | 11 | 3 | 33 |
| Standard — Content Systems Layer | 11 | 2 | 22 |
| Standard — Automation Layer | 11 | 2 | 22 |
| Bonus — Reinforcement & Flywheel | 10 | 1 | 10 |
| **TOTAL** | **53** | | **117** |

### Thresholds
- **PASS**: >= 94 points (80%)
- **CONDITIONAL**: >= 71 points (60%)
- **FAIL**: < 71 points

### If FAIL
1. Identify which layer is weakest — the stack is only as strong as its weakest layer
2. Build brand trust first if missing — no automation or product can replace genuine trust
3. Create one digital product if none exists — the stack needs a revenue engine
4. Automate at least the sales pipeline (landing page → checkout → delivery) before scaling content
