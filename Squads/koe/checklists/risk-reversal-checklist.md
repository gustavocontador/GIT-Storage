## 1. Guarantee Type Definition

```yaml
guarantee_type:
  selection:
    - [ ] Guarantee type explicitly chosen and documented
    - [ ] Type matches product nature:
      - Money-back guarantee for digital products
      - Results-based guarantee for coaching/consulting
      - Access guarantee for memberships/communities
      - Hybrid guarantee for high-ticket offers
    - [ ] Duration of guarantee defined (30, 60, 90 days or custom)
  structure:
    - [ ] Full refund vs partial refund vs credit — decision documented
    - [ ] Guarantee covers the primary fear of the buyer
    - [ ] Guarantee doesn't promise unrealistic outcomes
    - [ ] Multiple guarantee tiers considered (basic + premium)
```

---

## 2. Conditions Clarity

```yaml
conditions:
  transparency:
    - [ ] All conditions listed in plain language (no legal jargon for buyer)
    - [ ] Conditions are visible BEFORE purchase (not hidden in fine print)
    - [ ] Maximum 3-5 conditions (simplicity builds trust)
  fairness:
    - [ ] Conditions require reasonable effort, not impossible benchmarks
    - [ ] Conditions align with what a good-faith buyer would naturally do
    - [ ] No conditions designed to prevent ALL refunds (that's not a guarantee)
  documentation:
    - [ ] Process for claiming guarantee is step-by-step clear
    - [ ] Response time commitment stated (e.g., "refund within 7 business days")
    - [ ] Contact method for guarantee claims specified
```

---

## 3. Trust Building Mechanics

```yaml
trust_building:
  confidence_signals:
    - [ ] Guarantee language communicates creator confidence in the product
    - [ ] Phrasing is proactive ("I'm so confident that...") not defensive
    - [ ] Guarantee is mentioned early in the offer (not buried at the end)
  social_proof_integration:
    - [ ] Guarantee paired with success stories (proof it works)
    - [ ] Low refund rate mentioned if available (< 5%)
    - [ ] Testimonials from people who considered asking for refund but didn't
  koe_philosophy_alignment:
    - [ ] Risk reversal positions education as the safe bet
    - [ ] Framing: "Worst case, you keep everything and get your money back"
    - [ ] Aligns with "invest in yourself" narrative, not "buy with no risk"
```

---

## 4. Freeloader Prevention

```yaml
freeloader_prevention:
  filtering_mechanisms:
    - [ ] Conditions naturally filter out non-serious buyers
    - [ ] Completion requirement (must engage with X% of material)
    - [ ] Time-bound access to guarantee (not indefinite)
  behavioral_incentives:
    - [ ] Early engagement bonus (rewards action, not passivity)
    - [ ] Progress milestones that make quitting feel like loss
    - [ ] Community accountability that makes freeloading socially costly
  economic_protection:
    - [ ] Projected refund rate modeled (target < 5%)
    - [ ] Revenue impact of guarantee modeled (net positive after trust boost)
    - [ ] Worst-case refund scenario doesn't break the business
```

---

## 5. Presentation & Positioning

```yaml
presentation:
  naming:
    - [ ] Guarantee has a memorable name (not just "money-back guarantee")
    - [ ] Name communicates confidence and outcome
    - [ ] Name is unique to this brand/offer
  visual_placement:
    - [ ] Guarantee prominently displayed on sales page
    - [ ] Visual badge or seal created for the guarantee
    - [ ] Guarantee appears near the buy button (decision moment)
  copywriting:
    - [ ] Guarantee copy is concise (3-5 sentences max)
    - [ ] Emphasizes what buyer gains, not what they lose
    - [ ] Ends with confidence statement, not caveat
```

## Scoring

| Category | Items | Points Each | Max |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----|
| Critical — Guarantee Type Definition | 8 | 3 | 24 |
| Critical — Conditions Clarity | 8 | 3 | 24 |
| Standard — Trust Building Mechanics | 9 | 2 | 18 |
| Standard — Freeloader Prevention | 9 | 2 | 18 |
| Bonus — Presentation & Positioning | 8 | 1 | 8 |
| **TOTAL** | **42** | | **92** |

### Thresholds
- **PASS**: >= 74 points (80%)
- **CONDITIONAL**: >= 56 points (60%)
- **FAIL**: < 56 points

### If FAIL
1. Re-select guarantee type — ensure it matches product nature and buyer's primary fear
2. Simplify conditions to 3-5 maximum, written in plain language
3. Reposition guarantee as confidence signal, not legal requirement
4. Model freeloader risk — if projected refund > 10%, tighten completion requirements
