## 1. Entertainment Layer (Base)

```yaml
entertainment_layer:
  content_quality:
    - [ ] Free content genuinely entertaining (not boring "value" dumps)
    - [ ] Content uses storytelling, contrarian takes, or curiosity gaps
    - [ ] Audience retention metrics above platform averages
    - [ ] Content consumption leads to "I want more" feeling
  accessibility:
    - [ ] Available on at least 2 major platforms
    - [ ] Zero barrier to entry (no email required for first touch)
    - [ ] Content discoverable through search and algorithmic distribution
  brand_building:
    - [ ] Entertainment layer establishes creator's worldview
    - [ ] Audience forms parasocial trust through consistent presence
    - [ ] Content differentiates from competitors at this level
```

---

## 2. Education/Transformation Layer (Middle)

```yaml
transformation_layer:
  depth_increase:
    - [ ] Clearly more structured than entertainment layer
    - [ ] Includes frameworks, models, or systems (not just opinions)
    - [ ] Buyer learns something they couldn't figure out alone
    - [ ] Content organized in logical progression (not random modules)
  transformation_promise:
    - [ ] Specific before/after transformation articulated
    - [ ] Timeline for transformation realistic and stated
    - [ ] Transformation is identity-level (who they become, not just what they know)
  pricing_alignment:
    - [ ] Price reflects transformation value, not information quantity
    - [ ] Price accessible to target audience ($50-$500 range typical)
    - [ ] Price justified by comparison to alternatives (courses, degrees, consulting)
    - [ ] Clear value jump from free → paid (10x depth, not 10% more)
```

---

## 3. Implementation Layer (Top)

```yaml
implementation_layer:
  hands_on_support:
    - [ ] Buyer gets direct access to creator (calls, DMs, community)
    - [ ] Done-with-you or done-for-you elements included
    - [ ] Personalized feedback on buyer's specific situation
    - [ ] Accountability structure built in (check-ins, deadlines)
  speed_of_results:
    - [ ] Implementation layer delivers results faster than self-study
    - [ ] Templates, swipe files, or systems provided (not just teaching)
    - [ ] Buyer can see progress within first week
  pricing_premium:
    - [ ] Price reflects direct access and speed (3-10x education layer)
    - [ ] Price high enough to ensure commitment ($500-$5,000+ range)
    - [ ] Payment plans available for accessibility
    - [ ] Price increases with each cohort (early adopter advantage)
```

## 4. Ascension Path Design

```yaml
ascension_path:
  clarity:
    - [ ] Buyer can see the full path from free → entertainment → education → implementation
    - [ ] Each level clearly marketed and differentiated
    - [ ] No confusion about what's included at each tier
    - [ ] Natural "I need more" moment engineered at each transition
  friction_reduction:
    - [ ] Upgrade path is one-click or one-conversation (minimal friction)
    - [ ] Previous purchases credited toward higher tiers
    - [ ] Downgrades possible (reduces refund requests)
  value_compounding:
    - [ ] Each level builds on the previous (not standalone silos)
    - [ ] Higher tiers include lower tier access
    - [ ] Community gets richer as more people ascend
```

---

## 5. One-Person Business Sustainability

```yaml
sustainability:
  scalability:
    - [ ] Entertainment layer is fully automated (content + distribution)
    - [ ] Education layer is mostly automated (course + community)
    - [ ] Implementation layer has defined capacity limits
    - [ ] Total time commitment mapped per week at each tier
  revenue_modeling:
    - [ ] Revenue per tier projected with conversion assumptions
    - [ ] Break-even point calculated for each tier
    - [ ] 80/20 revenue distribution identified (which tier drives most revenue)
  sovereignty:
    - [ ] Creator maintains creative control at every tier
    - [ ] No tier requires skills the creator doesn't have or enjoy
    - [ ] Hierarchy can evolve as creator's interests change
```

## Scoring

| Category | Items | Points Each | Max |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----|
| Critical — Education/Transformation Layer | 11 | 3 | 33 |
| Critical — Ascension Path Design | 10 | 3 | 30 |
| Standard — Entertainment Layer | 9 | 2 | 18 |
| Standard — Implementation Layer | 11 | 2 | 22 |
| Bonus — Sustainability | 9 | 1 | 9 |
| **TOTAL** | **50** | | **112** |

### Thresholds
- **PASS**: >= 90 points (80%)
- **CONDITIONAL**: >= 68 points (60%)
- **FAIL**: < 68 points

### If FAIL
1. Map all three layers side-by-side — ensure each has distinct value and clear boundaries
2. Verify pricing at each tier follows the 10x depth rule (not just incrementally more content)
3. Design the ascension moment — what triggers a buyer to move up? If unclear, redesign transitions
4. Stress-test sustainability — if implementation layer is unsustainable, cap capacity and raise price
