  # Literature Review

  ## Introduction
  [Scope, organization, search strategy]

  ## Theme 1: [First major theme]
  [Review of studies on this theme]
  [Critical analysis, patterns, contradictions]

  ## Theme 2: [Second major theme]
  [Review of studies on this theme]
  [Critical analysis, patterns, contradictions]

  ## Research Gaps
  [What is NOT known or under-researched]
  [How your study addresses these gaps]

  ## Summary
  [Brief recap connecting to your research questions]

best_practices:
  - Integrate sources (don't just list studies)
  - Use transition phrases to show relationships
  - Be critical (analyze, don't just summarize)
  - Identify contradictions and explain why
  - Show how literature connects to your RQs
  - Use recent sources (< 5 years when possible)
  - Include seminal/classic works when relevant

common_pitfalls:
  - Just summarizing each paper sequentially
  - No critical analysis or synthesis
  - Missing key papers in the field
  - Not identifying research gaps
  - Poor organization (hard to follow)
  - Too much detail on peripheral topics
