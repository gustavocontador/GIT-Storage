## Scoring

| Category | Items | Points Each | Max |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----|
| Critical — Proof Elements | 11 | 3 | 33 |
| Critical — Framework Naming & Ownership | 11 | 3 | 33 |
| Standard — Teaching Demonstrates Mastery | 11 | 2 | 22 |
| Standard — Platform Presence Consistency | 12 | 2 | 24 |
| Bonus — Authority Compounding | 10 | 1 | 10 |
| **TOTAL** | **55** | | **122** |

### Thresholds
- **PASS**: >= 98 points (80%)
- **CONDITIONAL**: >= 74 points (60%)
- **FAIL**: < 74 points

### If FAIL
1. Gather proof elements first — authority without proof is just opinion; collect results, testimonials, and case studies
2. Name your framework — if you don't have one, distill your unique process into a named, teachable model
3. Audit teaching quality — record yourself explaining your core concept; if it's not clear and compelling, simplify
4. Unify platform presence — pick one visual identity and messaging and roll it out everywhere within 1 week
