|------|-------------|----------|
| **Kickoff** | Squad aligns on AI-FIRST vision | Day 1 |
| **Discovery** | Find 3-5 viable opportunities | Days 2-3 |
| **Roundtable** | Discuss, analyze, decide on #1 idea | Day 4 |
| **Build** | Full implementation with architecture | Weeks 1-2 |
| **Validation** | Real market testing & data collection | Weeks 2-3 |

## 🎯 How the Roundtable Works

1. **AI Strategist** brings perspective on Claude Code possibilities
2. **Business Strategist** analyzes market opportunity & revenue potential
3. **Product Manager** defines what to build & why
4. **Master Coordinator** synthesizes all perspectives
5. **Decision made** - entire Tier 3 executes

This creates dynamic, multi-perspective decision making.
