## How to Use This Checklist

1. Read through the entire script once before starting.
2. Check each item in order.
3. For any unchecked item, note the specific issue in the "Notes" column.
4. Items marked **(Critical)** must pass — any failure requires revision.
5. Items marked **(Warning)** should pass — failures reduce quality but may be acceptable.
6. Items marked **(Best Practice)** are recommended — failures are minor.
7. After completing the checklist, count results and determine overall verdict.

## HOOK (First 30 Seconds)

### Attention Grab (0:00-0:05)

- [ ] **(Critical)** First sentence/frame immediately grabs attention — no warm-up, no preamble.
- [ ] **(Critical)** Opening line is specific, not generic. Uses a bold claim, surprising stat, provocative question, or story drop.
- [ ] **(Warning)** First 5 seconds could stop a scroller or prevent a click-away.
- [ ] **(Critical)** No "Hey guys, welcome back to my channel" or any variant of throat-clearing opener.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Opening word is a power word (not "So", "Today", "In this video").

### Video Promise (0:05-0:15)

- [ ] **(Critical)** Within the first 15 seconds, the viewer knows what they will get from watching.
- [ ] **(Warning)** The promise is specific, not vague ("you'll learn the exact 3-step process" not "I'll talk about strategies").
- [ ] **(Critical)** The promise aligns with the title — a viewer who clicked the title feels they are in the right place.
- [ ] **(Warning)** The promise aligns with the thumbnail — visual expectation is met.

### Stakes Established (0:15-0:30)

- [ ] **(Critical)** Stakes are clear — the viewer understands what they gain from watching or lose from leaving.
- [ ] **(Warning)** Stakes feel personal to the viewer ("this affects YOUR money" not just abstract information).
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Stakes escalate from personal to broader implications.

### Hook Framework

- [ ] **(Warning)** Hook uses a proven framework (PVSS, TTS, Cold Open, or hybrid).
- [ ] **(Critical)** At least one open loop is planted in the hook (the Master Loop).
- [ ] **(Warning)** Hook includes a social proof or authority signal within 20 seconds.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Hook is under 60 seconds (ideally 30-45 seconds).

## STRUCTURE

### Section Organization

- [ ] **(Critical)** Script has clearly defined sections (not a single rambling block).
- [ ] **(Critical)** Sections follow a logical flow — each section builds on the previous one.
- [ ] **(Warning)** Each section serves the grand payoff — no tangential or unnecessary sections.
- [ ] **(Warning)** Section count is appropriate for video length (5-7 sections for 10-15 min videos).
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Sections are labeled or clearly delineated for production.

### Setup-Tension-Payoff (STP) Per Section

- [ ] **(Critical)** Each section contains a clear Setup (context/question).
- [ ] **(Critical)** Each section contains Tension (conflict, complication, or suspense).
- [ ] **(Critical)** Each section contains a Payoff (resolution, insight, or revelation).
- [ ] **(Warning)** Payoff in each section opens a question for the next section (chained engagement).
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** STP balance is appropriate — no section is 90% setup.

### Transitions

- [ ] **(Critical)** Section transitions use But/Therefore logic (not "And then...").
- [ ] **(Warning)** Transitions feel natural and conversational (not mechanical).
- [ ] **(Warning)** No transition breaks the viewer's momentum or gives permission to leave.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Transitions alternate between But and Therefore for rhythm.

### Golden Thread

- [ ] **(Critical)** A single throughline (golden thread) connects all sections.
- [ ] **(Warning)** The golden thread is explicitly or implicitly referenced in every section.
- [ ] **(Critical)** Grand payoff reminder appears at least every 5-6 minutes (for videos >10 min).
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Golden thread references vary in wording (not repetitive).

---

## RETENTION MECHANICS

### Open Loops

- [ ] **(Critical)** Multiple open loops present throughout the script.
- [ ] **(Critical)** At least 3 open loops are simultaneously active at the peak point.
- [ ] **(Critical)** At least 1 open loop is active at all times after the hook.
- [ ] **(Warning)** Open loops vary in type (question, mystery, promise, teaser, unresolved conflict).
- [ ] **(Warning)** All opened loops are eventually closed — no dangling loops left unresolved.
- [ ] **(Critical)** The Master Loop (grand payoff) is opened in the hook and closed near the end.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** New loops open just before potential viewer drop-off points.

### Pattern Interrupts

- [ ] **(Critical)** Pattern interrupts are present throughout the script (not just in the hook).
- [ ] **(Critical)** Average frequency is 45-60 seconds between interrupts.
- [ ] **(Critical)** No gap between pattern interrupts exceeds 90 seconds.
- [ ] **(Warning)** Pattern interrupt types vary (tonal shift, story, question, analogy, visual cue, humor, data).
- [ ] **(Warning)** First pattern interrupt occurs within the first 30 seconds.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Pattern interrupts feel organic — not forced or formulaic.

### Re-Hooks

- [ ] **(Critical)** Re-hook present at the 25% mark.
- [ ] **(Critical)** Re-hook present at the 50% mark.
- [ ] **(Critical)** Re-hook present at the 75% mark.
- [ ] **(Warning)** Each re-hook teases upcoming content or escalates stakes.
- [ ] **(Warning)** Re-hooks are strong (score 6+ on a 1-10 scale) — not weak or generic.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Re-hooks use different techniques (not all the same type).

### Stakes Escalation

- [ ] **(Critical)** Stakes increase progressively throughout the script.
- [ ] **(Warning)** No stakes plateau lasts more than 2 consecutive sections.
- [ ] **(Critical)** Highest stakes moment aligns with the climax/grand payoff.
- [ ] **(Warning)** No "stakes reset" occurs without immediate rebuilding.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Stakes feel personal to the viewer at multiple points.

### Dead Zone Prevention

- [ ] **(Critical)** No point in the script where a viewer could safely leave without missing what was promised.
- [ ] **(Warning)** No segment longer than 2 minutes without a new curiosity hook or tension spike.
- [ ] **(Critical)** Emotional pendulum shifts at least every 90 seconds — never same register too long.
- [ ] **(Warning)** The script never "gives permission" to leave (no full resolution without new question).

## VALUE DELIVERY

### PCCE Compliance

- [ ] **(Warning)** Every sentence can be classified as P (Progression), C (Conflict), Cx (Context), or E (Emotion).
- [ ] **(Critical)** FLAG content (filler, redundant, off-topic) is less than 5% of all sentences.
- [ ] **(Warning)** No context dumps — 3 or more consecutive Cx sentences are broken up with P or C.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** P:C:Cx:E ratio is approximately 30:20:25:20 (with <5% FLAG).

### Specificity

- [ ] **(Critical)** Script includes specific examples, data points, numbers, names, or case studies — not generic advice.
- [ ] **(Warning)** Every claim is backed by evidence (data, story, example, or logical reasoning).
- [ ] **(Critical)** No unnecessary filler or preamble. Every sentence earns its place.
- [ ] **(Warning)** Analogies and metaphors are used to make complex ideas accessible.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** "Show, don't tell" approach — stories and examples over abstract statements.

### Audience Value

- [ ] **(Critical)** The viewer learns something new, useful, or perspective-changing.
- [ ] **(Warning)** Actionable takeaways are present — the viewer knows what to do next.
- [ ] **(Warning)** Content is appropriate for the target audience's knowledge level.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** "Insight density" is high — multiple valuable moments per minute.

---

## CTA (Call to Action)

### Placement

- [ ] **(Critical)** Primary CTA is placed after the biggest value delivery moment (not at the start).
- [ ] **(Warning)** CTA feels earned — the viewer has received enough value to feel compelled.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** 3-point CTA strategy: soft CTA mid-video, primary CTA after payoff, next-video CTA at end.

### Quality

- [ ] **(Critical)** CTA is brief — maximum 8 seconds for any single CTA.
- [ ] **(Critical)** CTA is specific — not generic "like and subscribe" but a specific ask with a reason.
- [ ] **(Warning)** CTA connects to the value just delivered ("If you found this useful, here's how to get more...").
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** CTA language is conversational, not salesy or desperate.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** End-screen CTA teases the next video with a hook.

---

## PRODUCTION CUES

### B-Roll

- [ ] **(Warning)** B-roll descriptions are included throughout the script (every 15-30 seconds of content).
- [ ] **(Warning)** B-roll descriptions are specific enough for an editor to source or create footage.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** B-roll cues match the emotional tone of the content at that point.

### Graphics and Text

- [ ] **(Warning)** On-screen text/graphic callouts are noted for key data points, quotes, or emphasis.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Graphics include charts, diagrams, or visual aids for complex information.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Lower thirds or name/title cards noted where appropriate.

### Music

- [ ] **(Warning)** Background music mood annotations are included at emotional shift points.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Music transitions align with tonal shifts in the script.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** No single music mood runs for more than 3 minutes.

### Voice/Delivery

- [ ] **(Warning)** Speaking pace notes are included at tonal changes and emphasis points.
- [ ] **(Warning)** Emphasis words or phrases are marked (bold, underline, or annotation).
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Pause points noted for dramatic effect.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Tone shift cues align with emotional arc (e.g., "[VOICE: drop to serious]").

## SPOKEN DELIVERY

### Readability for Speech

- [ ] **(Warning)** Average sentence length is 12-15 words (conversational, not academic).
- [ ] **(Warning)** Contractions are used naturally (it's, don't, you'd — not "it is", "do not").
- [ ] **(Warning)** No jargon unless defined or audience-appropriate.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Active voice throughout — minimal passive constructions.
- [ ] **(Best Practice)** Rhetorical questions used to engage the viewer.
