If you have a **learning challenge to solve**:

1. Activate the Chief: `@dopamine-learning-chief`
2. Describe your challenge: "We need to help our team improve [X]"
3. Chief will ask clarifying questions, then route through optimal agent sequence
4. Expected timeline: 2-3 days for complete system design

### For Individual Agent Queries
If you know exactly which agent you need:

```
@schultz           # Dopamine architecture questions
@fogg              # Behavior design questions
@chou              # Motivation & drive questions

## Agent Roles & Expertise

### TIER 0: DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS

These agents diagnose the learning challenge from multiple perspectives:

| Agent | Expertise | Key Output | Time |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------|
| **Schultz** | Dopamine signals, RPE timing, learning rates | Neurochemical foundation | 4h |
| **Fogg** | Behavior mechanics, motivation-ability-prompt | Behavioral diagnosis | 4h |
| **Chou** | Psychological drives, intrinsic motivation | Drive activation map | 4h |
| **Csikszentmihalyi** | Challenge-skill balance, flow state | Experience calibration | 4h |
| **Deterding** | Ethics, dark patterns, autonomy ⚠️ **GATE** | Validation (PASS/CONDITIONAL/REDESIGN) | 4h |

**Tier 0 Phase:** All agents work in parallel → Deterding validates → Decision gate

**Output:** Complete diagnostic foundation approved for execution

### TIER 1: EXECUTION AGENTS

These agents execute the learning system design on top of validated diagnostics:

| Agent | Expertise | Key Output | Inputs From |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Gee** | 36 learning principles, pedagogy, sequencing | Day-by-day learning sequence | All Tier 0 |
| **Eyal** | Hook Model, engagement loops, habits | Trigger-action-reward cycles | Gee |
| **McGonigal** | Hero's Journey, resilience, meaning | Narrative framing | Eyal |
| **Kapp** | Feedback design, assessment, objectives | Instructional specifications | McGonigal |

**Tier 1 Phase:** Sequential handoffs, each building on previous

**Output:** Complete integrated learning system ready for implementation

## How It Works: Standard Workflow

### Step 1: Initial Request
```
User: "We need to improve our quarterly meetings. People are passive."

Chief: "Let me ask some clarifying questions..."
- Learning goal: Increase participation and quality of contributions?
- Context: 8 people, 1 hour meetings, hierarchical?
- Timeline: 6 weeks?
- Success metric: 3-5 meaningful contributions per person per meeting?
```

### Step 2: Tier 0 Diagnostic Phase (2 days)
```
Chief routes to all 5 Tier 0 agents in parallel:

Schultz  → "What dopamine signals would reinforce speaking up?"
Fogg     → "What's blocking the behavior? Motivation? Ability? Prompt?"
Chou     → "What drives activate? Which are primary for this person?"
Mihaly   → "Is the challenge-skill balance right for flow?"
Deterding → "Is this ethical? Any dark patterns? ✓ APPROVED"
```

### Step 3: Tier 0 Integration & Gate
```
Chief integrates all diagnostics:
- Dopamine foundation solid ✓
- Behavioral bottleneck identified ✓
- Drives aligned with goals ✓
- Flow zone calibrated ✓
- Ethical validation passed ✓

Decision: PROCEED TO TIER 1
```

### Step 4: Tier 1 Execution Phase (2-3 days)
```
Sequential handoffs:

Gee      → "Here's the 6-week learning sequence with scaffolding"
  ↓
Eyal     → "Here are the habit loops that keep people engaged"
  ↓
McGonigal → "Here's the narrative: Growing as voice in your organization"
  ↓
Kapp     → "Here's the specific feedback for each milestone"
```

### Step 5: Delivery
```
Chief delivers complete system:
- Pedagogical design (Gee)
- Engagement architecture (Eyal)
- Narrative frame (McGonigal)
- Assessment protocol (Kapp)
- All validated against Tier 0 diagnostics

Ready for implementation team.
```

## Philosophy

The dopamine-learning squad is built on core principles:

1. **Never take the lazy path**
   - Deep analysis before implementation
   - All 10 perspectives matter
   - Quality gates before execution

2. **Return time to the human**
   - Detailed reports reduce cognitive load
   - No shortcuts that compromise quality
   - Every agent adds real value

3. **Respect the learner's autonomy**
   - No manipulation, even well-intentioned
   - Transparent about why design is as it is
   - Support genuine choice

4. **Ground in rigorous science**
   - Every framework from published research
   - Every principle evidence-based
   - Every design decision justified

5. **Integrate, don't isolate**
   - Neuroscience + behavior + motivation + experience + ethics + pedagogy
   - No aspect alone is sufficient
   - System coherence is essential
