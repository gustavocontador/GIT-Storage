## 1. Domain Selection

```yaml
domain_selection:
  minimum_threshold:
    - [ ] Minimum 2 distinct domains identified for synthesis
    - [ ] Domains are genuinely distinct (not sub-categories of the same field)
    - [ ] Each domain has sufficient depth of understanding (not surface-level)
    - [ ] Domain combination is novel (not a well-trodden analogy)
  domain_documentation:
    - [ ] Each domain's core principle clearly stated
    - [ ] Key vocabulary from each domain identified
    - [ ] Leading thinkers in each domain referenced
```

---

## 2. Connection Identification

```yaml
connection:
  structural_parallels:
    - [ ] Shared underlying structure identified between domains
    - [ ] The parallel is structural (not just metaphorical)
    - [ ] The connection survives when you push past the surface similarity
    - [ ] At least 3 specific parallels documented
  tension_points:
    - [ ] Where the domains disagree or diverge is noted
    - [ ] Tensions create productive insight (not just confusion)
    - [ ] Divergence points suggest new questions worth exploring
    - [ ] The synthesis acknowledges limitations of the analogy
```

---

## 3. Novel Insight Generation

```yaml
novel_insight:
  originality:
    - [ ] The synthesis produces an insight that exists in NEITHER domain alone
    - [ ] A Google search for this specific connection yields few or no results
    - [ ] The insight is surprising to experts in at least one of the domains
    - [ ] The insight is not a restatement of something someone else synthesized
  specificity:
    - [ ] The insight is concrete enough to apply (not vague "everything is connected")
    - [ ] A specific action, decision, or framework emerges from the synthesis
    - [ ] The insight can be tested or validated against real-world data
```

---

## 4. Actionability

```yaml
actionability:
  practical_output:
    - [ ] The synthesis produces at least 1 actionable recommendation
    - [ ] The recommendation is implementable within 1 week
    - [ ] The recommendation addresses a real problem the audience faces
    - [ ] The recommendation is novel (audience would not have arrived at it from one domain alone)
  framework_potential:
    - [ ] The synthesis can be structured as a reusable framework
    - [ ] The framework has a memorable name
    - [ ] The framework can be taught in under 5 minutes
    - [ ] The framework applies beyond the specific examples used
```

---

## 5. Communication Readiness

```yaml
communication:
  iceberg_alignment:
    - [ ] Surface explanation works without domain expertise
    - [ ] Depth reveals the cross-domain connection for advanced readers
    - [ ] APAG structure applicable for content creation
  content_formats:
    - [ ] The synthesis works as a tweet (one-liner version)
    - [ ] The synthesis works as a newsletter (expanded version)
    - [ ] The synthesis works as a YouTube video (story version)
    - [ ] The synthesis works as a course module (deep-dive version)
```

---

## 6. Validation

```yaml
validation:
  stress_test:
    - [ ] Counter-examples considered and addressed
    - [ ] Synthesis survives "So what?" test (why should anyone care?)
    - [ ] Synthesis survives "Who cares?" test (specific audience identified)
    - [ ] Synthesis survives "Prove it" test (evidence from both domains)
  peer_check:
    - [ ] Shared with someone from Domain A — did they find it valuable?
    - [ ] Shared with someone from Domain B — did they find it valuable?
    - [ ] Shared with a generalist — did they understand it?
```

## Scoring

| Category | Items | Points Each | Max |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----|
| Critical — Domain Selection & Novel Insight | 11 | 3 | 33 |
| Standard — Connection, Actionability & Communication | 15 | 2 | 30 |
| Bonus — Validation & Peer Check | 7 | 1 | 7 |
| **TOTAL** | **33** | | **70** |

### Thresholds
- **PASS**: >= 56 points (80%)
- **CONDITIONAL**: >= 42 points (60%)
- **FAIL**: < 42 points

### If FAIL
1. Verify your domains are truly distinct — "marketing" and "sales" is NOT cross-domain
2. Write the connection as: "Domain A says X. Domain B says Y. Together, they reveal Z."
3. If Z is not surprising, the connection is too obvious. Go deeper or pick different domains.
4. Test actionability: can someone DO something different after reading your synthesis?
