## 1. Attention (A)

```yaml
attention:
  hook_presence:
    - [ ] Opening hook present in first 1-2 sentences
    - [ ] Hook creates immediate pattern interrupt
    - [ ] Hook targets a specific pain, desire, or curiosity gap
    - [ ] Hook is about the READER, not the writer
  hook_quality:
    - [ ] Hook stops the scroll (social media test)
    - [ ] Hook makes a bold claim or asks a provocative question
    - [ ] Hook sets up the Perspective shift that follows
    - [ ] Hook can stand alone as a tweet
```

---

## 2. Perspective (P)

```yaml
perspective:
  shift_clarity:
    - [ ] A clear "before and after" mental model shift articulated
    - [ ] The old perspective (what most people believe) stated explicitly
    - [ ] The new perspective (your contrarian position) stated explicitly
    - [ ] The shift feels earned — not just stated but demonstrated
  mechanism:
    - [ ] WHY the old perspective is wrong or incomplete is explained
    - [ ] Evidence or story supports the new perspective
    - [ ] Reader can pinpoint the moment their thinking changed
    - [ ] Perspective shift connects logically to the Attention hook
```

---

## 3. Advantage (A)

```yaml
advantage:
  tangible_benefit:
    - [ ] Clear advantage of adopting the new perspective articulated
    - [ ] Advantage is specific and measurable (not vague "think better")
    - [ ] Advantage addresses a real problem the reader currently faces
    - [ ] Reader can envision the advantage in their own life
  credibility:
    - [ ] Advantage backed by personal experience, data, or case study
    - [ ] Advantage demonstrates what is possible (not just theoretical)
    - [ ] Advantage creates desire to act (emotional, not just logical)
    - [ ] Advantage differentiates from competing approaches
```

---

## 4. Gamify (G)

```yaml
gamify:
  action_clarity:
    - [ ] Specific next action provided (not "go think about this")
    - [ ] Action is achievable within 24 hours
    - [ ] Action has a clear success metric (reader knows when they have done it)
    - [ ] Action builds momentum toward a larger transformation
  engagement:
    - [ ] Action feels like a challenge, not a chore
    - [ ] Progress is visible and satisfying
    - [ ] CTA connects back to the Advantage (doing this = getting that)
    - [ ] Reader wants to share their result (social proof potential)
```

---

## 5. APAG Flow

```yaml
apag_flow:
  transitions:
    - [ ] Attention flows naturally into Perspective (no jarring jump)
    - [ ] Perspective flows naturally into Advantage (logical progression)
    - [ ] Advantage flows naturally into Gamify (motivation to action)
    - [ ] The entire piece reads as one coherent argument
  pacing:
    - [ ] Attention section is shortest (5-10% of total)
    - [ ] Perspective section is the core (40-50% of total)
    - [ ] Advantage section proves the case (25-30% of total)
    - [ ] Gamify section is concise and direct (10-15% of total)
```

---

## 6. Quality Validation

```yaml
quality:
  format_readiness:
    - [ ] APAG structure works for chosen format (newsletter, video, thread)
    - [ ] Each section has been edited for clarity (no filler)
    - [ ] Content passes the "read aloud" test (natural voice)
    - [ ] Dan Koe's writing style principles applied (conversational, direct, philosophical)
  veto_conditions:
    - [ ] VETO if Attention section is about the writer, not the reader
    - [ ] VETO if Perspective section does not change how the reader thinks
    - [ ] VETO if Advantage section is vague ("it will change your life")
    - [ ] VETO if Gamify section has no specific action
```

## Scoring

| Category | Items | Points Each | Max |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----|
| Critical — APAG Core Elements (A+P+A+G) | 16 | 3 | 48 |
| Standard — Flow & Pacing | 8 | 2 | 16 |
| Bonus — Quality & Format Readiness | 8 | 1 | 8 |
| **TOTAL** | **32** | | **72** |

### Thresholds
- **PASS**: >= 58 points (80%)
- **CONDITIONAL**: >= 43 points (60%)
- **FAIL**: < 43 points

### If FAIL
1. Write each APAG section as a separate paragraph with its label (A: / P: / A: / G:)
2. Check: does A stop the scroll? Does P shift thinking? Does A prove benefit? Does G give action?
3. If any section fails its core test, rewrite ONLY that section before touching anything else
4. Read the piece aloud — if any transition sounds forced, the flow needs work
