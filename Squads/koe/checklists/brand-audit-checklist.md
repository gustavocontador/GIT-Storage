## 1. Brand → Trust Pipeline

```yaml
brand_trust_pipeline:
  first_impression:
    - [ ] New visitor understands what you do within 10 seconds of landing on profile
    - [ ] Bio/headline communicates value proposition, not just job title
    - [ ] Pinned/featured content showcases best work
    - [ ] Visual identity is professional and consistent
  trust_acceleration:
    - [ ] Content demonstrates expertise within first 3 pieces consumed
    - [ ] Personal story creates emotional connection
    - [ ] Proof elements visible without deep digging (results, testimonials)
    - [ ] Free value given generously (no gatekeeping basics)
  trust_to_subscriber:
    - [ ] Clear path from content consumer → email subscriber
    - [ ] Lead magnet aligned with core audience pain point
    - [ ] Opt-in friction minimal (email only, no long forms)
    - [ ] Welcome sequence builds deeper trust (not immediate sell)

  lead_nurturing:
    - [ ] Email nurture sequence active (5-10 emails minimum)

    - [ ] Segmentation based on interest or behavior
    - [ ] Re-engagement sequence for inactive subscribers

    - [ ] Qualified lead criteria defined (budget, need, timing)

  language_consistency:
    - [ ] Key terms and phrases used consistently (brand vocabulary)
    - [ ] Tone of voice consistent across platforms
    - [ ] Topics stay within personal monopoly boundaries
  anti_patterns:

    - [ ] No desperate selling that undermines brand trust
    - [ ] No off-brand collaborations that confuse audience
```

## 4. Niche = You (Personal Brand Depth)

```yaml
niche_is_you:
  identity_integration:
    - [ ] Brand is inseparable from the person (not a faceless company)
    - [ ] Content reflects genuine interests, opinions, and experiences
    - [ ] Audience feels they know the real person behind the brand
    - [ ] Brand would not survive if creator was replaced by generic expert
  evolution_authenticity:

## 5. Sovereignty Preservation

```yaml
sovereignty:
  platform_independence:
    - [ ] Email list is primary owned asset (not dependent on social algorithms)
    - [ ] Website or landing page owned and controlled
    - [ ] Content backed up and portable (not locked in one platform)
  revenue_sovereignty:
    - [ ] Income not dependent on brand deals or sponsorships only
    - [ ] Own products/services generate majority of revenue
    - [ ] No single client represents > 20% of revenue
  creative_sovereignty:
    - [ ] Content agenda set by creator, not audience demands
    - [ ] Saying "no" to off-brand opportunities is practiced
    - [ ] Creative burnout signals monitored and addressed
    - [ ] Brand allows for personal time and space (sustainable pace)
```

  system_resilience:
    - [ ] Lead generation works even without new content (evergreen assets)
    - [ ] Multiple lead sources active (not single-platform dependent)
    - [ ] System tested under stress (what if one platform banned you?)
```

## Scoring

| Category | Items | Points Each | Max |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----|
| Critical — Brand → Trust Pipeline | 12 | 3 | 36 |
| Critical — Trust → Leads Pipeline | 11 | 3 | 33 |
| Standard — Messaging Consistency | 11 | 2 | 22 |
| Standard — Niche = You | 11 | 2 | 22 |
| Bonus — Sovereignty Preservation | 10 | 1 | 10 |
| Bonus — Lead Gen Health | 7 | 1 | 7 |
| **TOTAL** | **62** | | **130** |

### Thresholds
- **PASS**: >= 104 points (80%)
- **CONDITIONAL**: >= 78 points (60%)
- **FAIL**: < 78 points

### If FAIL
1. Fix first impression — if visitors don't understand you in 10 seconds, rewrite bio and featured content
2. Build lead nurture sequence — if trust doesn't convert to leads, the pipeline is broken at the middle
3. Audit messaging for contradictions — one inconsistent message can undo months of trust-building
4. Ensure email list is growing — if it's stagnant, the sovereignty layer is at risk; add or improve lead magnet
5. Run the "platform ban" thought experiment — if losing one platform would kill your business, diversify immediately
