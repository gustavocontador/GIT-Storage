## 1. Multi-Domain Foundation

```yaml
multi_domain:
  domain_inventory:
    - [ ] Minimum 3 distinct knowledge domains actively cultivated
    - [ ] Each domain has dedicated learning sources
    - [ ] Domains span at least 2 of: business, philosophy, psychology, science, technology, art
    - [ ] No single domain exceeds 50% of total knowledge investment
  depth_validation:
    - [ ] Each domain has minimum 6 months of active study
    - [ ] Practitioner-level understanding in at least 2 domains
    - [ ] Can explain each domain's core principles to a beginner
    - [ ] Aware of current debates and frontiers in each domain
```

---

## 2. Intersection Innovation

```yaml
intersection:
  connection_quality:
    - [ ] Novel connections identified between 2+ domains
    - [ ] Connection is non-obvious (not a common analogy)
    - [ ] Connection produces actionable insight (not just intellectual entertainment)
    - [ ] Connection has been stress-tested against counter-examples
  innovation_markers:
    - [ ] The synthesis creates something that didn't exist in either domain alone
    - [ ] The insight changes how you approach a real problem
    - [ ] Others in single-domain silos find it surprising or valuable
    - [ ] The connection can be named and taught (framework potential)
```

## 3. Renaissance Identity

```yaml
renaissance_identity:
  anti_specialist:
    - [ ] Resists pressure to "pick one lane"
    - [ ] Personal brand reflects multi-domain expertise
    - [ ] Content draws from multiple knowledge pools
    - [ ] Audience understands you as a generalist-with-depth
  unique_positioning:
    - [ ] "You Are The Niche" principle applied — your unique combination IS the niche
    - [ ] No direct competitor has the same domain combination
    - [ ] This creates a Personal Monopoly through intersection
    - [ ] Domain combination aligned with genuine curiosity (not market chasing)
```

## 4. Synthesis Output Quality

```yaml
synthesis_output:
  naming:
    - [ ] Cross-domain insight has a memorable name or label
    - [ ] Framework structure is clear (not vague analogy)
    - [ ] Can be communicated in under 2 minutes
  depth_and_breadth:
    - [ ] Surface explanation is simple and accessible
    - [ ] Underlying research is substantial (Iceberg Model applied)
    - [ ] Multiple examples from different domains support the insight
    - [ ] Counter-arguments anticipated and addressed
```

---

## 5. Renaissance Sustainability

```yaml
sustainability:
  continuous_learning:
    - [ ] New domains explored at least quarterly
    - [ ] Existing domains refreshed with new sources
    - [ ] Cross-domain reading list maintained
    - [ ] "Adjacent possible" domains identified for future exploration
  output_cadence:
    - [ ] At least 1 cross-domain synthesis per month
    - [ ] Synthesis quality improving over time (not just quantity)
    - [ ] Audience feedback incorporated into domain prioritization
```

## Scoring

| Category | Items | Points Each | Max |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----|
| Critical — Multi-Domain & Intersection Innovation | 12 | 3 | 36 |
| Standard — Identity & Output Quality | 12 | 2 | 24 |
| Bonus — Sustainability & Continuous Learning | 6 | 1 | 6 |
| **TOTAL** | **30** | | **66** |

### Thresholds
- **PASS**: >= 53 points (80%)
- **CONDITIONAL**: >= 40 points (60%)
- **FAIL**: < 40 points

### If FAIL
1. List every domain you have studied for 6+ months — if fewer than 3, add one NOW
2. Force one cross-domain connection this week — even if it feels forced
3. Write a 500-word essay explaining a concept from Domain A using language from Domain B
4. Share the synthesis with someone in each domain and note their reactions
