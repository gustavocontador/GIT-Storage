    description: Resolve any screening conflicts (if dual screening)
    agent: research-chief
    estimated_duration: 0.5 days
    condition: dual_screening == true

success_criteria:
  - All papers screened against criteria
  - Exclusion reasons documented
  - For systematic reviews: dual screening completed
  - Inter-rater agreement calculated (if dual screening)

deliverables:
  - List of included papers
  - List of excluded papers with reasons
  - Screening log with decisions
  - PRISMA flow diagram updated

best_practices:
  - Define clear inclusion/exclusion criteria upfront
  - Screen conservatively at title/abstract (when in doubt, include)
  - Use dual screening for systematic reviews (two independent reviewers)
  - Document reasons for exclusion
  - Calculate inter-rater agreement (Cohen's kappa)
  - Resolve conflicts through discussion or third reviewer

inclusion_criteria_example:
  - Published in peer-reviewed journal
  - Published between 2015-2025
  - Primary research (not reviews or editorials)
  - Focus on AI in K-12 or higher education
  - Quantitative or qualitative methodology
  - English language

exclusion_criteria_example:
  - Conference abstracts (not full papers)
  - Opinion pieces or editorials
  - Non-empirical studies
  - Focus on non-educational AI applications
  - Animal studies or non-human subjects

common_pitfalls:
  - Criteria too vague (leads to inconsistent screening)
  - Cherry-picking papers that support your hypothesis
  - Single reviewer screening (bias risk)
  - Not documenting exclusion reasons
  - Screening too strictly at title/abstract (miss relevant papers)
