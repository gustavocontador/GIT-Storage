# Platform Plan

```yaml
id: platform-plan
execution_type: Agent
purpose: Create a platform-specific distribution plan that maximizes content reach by adapting one pillar piece into native formats across all active platforms.
executor: @gary-vaynerchuk
inputs:
  - Attention audit results (platform scores and tier ranking)
  - Content pillars from content-philosophy task
  - Weekly plan or content calendar
  - Platform-native rules per platform
preconditions:
  - Attention audit completed (platform priorities defined)
  - Content pillars established
  - At least 1 pillar content piece planned or created
steps:
  1. Define pillar content cadence:
     - 1 long-form piece per week (YouTube video, newsletter, or long post)
     - This is the "source" for all distribution
  2. Map GaryVee Content Model distribution:
     - Pillar → Document the creation process (behind-scenes)
     - Pillar → Extract 3-5 key quotes/insights
     - Pillar → Create micro-content per platform
     - Pillar → Community responses and engagement content
  3. Create platform distribution matrix:
     - Instagram: 1 Reel (hook moment), 1 Carousel (key insights), 3 Stories
     - YouTube: 1 Long-form OR 2 Shorts from pillar
     - TikTok: 2-3 clips (raw cuts from pillar, different hooks)
     - LinkedIn: 1 text post (professional angle of same topic)
     - Substack: 1 newsletter (deep dive on pillar topic)
  4. Set posting frequency per tier:
     - Tier 1 platform: Daily (mix of pillar derivatives + native content)
     - Tier 2 platforms: 3-4x per week
     - Tier 3 platforms: 1-2x per week (repurposed only)
  5. Define adaptation rules (NOT just reposting):
     - Each platform gets native format (aspect ratio, length, tone)
     - Instagram: visual-first, punchy captions
     - LinkedIn: professional context, longer text
     - TikTok: raw energy, no polish
     - YouTube: structured, value-dense
     - Substack: intimate, personal depth
  6. Build weekly distribution timeline:
     - Day 1: Create pillar content
     - Day 2-3: Distribute derivatives to Tier 1
     - Day 3-5: Adapt and post to Tier 2
     - Day 5-7: Repurpose to Tier 3 + engage
  7. Set tracking metrics per platform
outputs:
  - Platform Distribution Matrix (table format):
    - Platform | Format | Frequency | Adaptation rule | Metric
  - Weekly distribution timeline
  - Content adaptation guidelines per platform
  - Tracking dashboard template
validation:
  - All active platforms covered with specific formats
  - Distribution flows from 1 pillar (not created from scratch per platform)
  - Frequency is realistic for one person (even with batching)
  - Adaptation rules are platform-native (not copy-paste)
  - Clear connection between content and Next Step conversion
