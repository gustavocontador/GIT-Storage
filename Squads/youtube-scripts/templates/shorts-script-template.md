# YouTube Shorts Script Template

> **Purpose:** This template produces high-retention YouTube Shorts (~34 seconds) using the Bookend Method popularized by Jenny Hoyos. The core principle: write the hook FIRST, write the last line SECOND, then fill in the middle. The first and last lines are the "bookends" that determine whether a viewer watches and rewatches.
>
> **Key stats to target:**
> - Duration: ~34 seconds (the sweet spot for completion rate)
> - Retention: 90%+ (Shorts algorithm favors near-complete watches)
> - Readability: 5th grade or below (broadest possible audience)
> - Rewatch rate: High (the last line should make them want to see it again)

## The Bookend Method -- Writing Order

**Step 1:** Write the HOOK (first line) -- this determines if they stop scrolling.
**Step 2:** Write the LAST LINE -- this determines if they rewatch or swipe.
**Step 3:** Fill in the SETUP and BUT/THEN -- this is the connective tissue.

The hook and last line are the two highest-leverage sentences in the entire Short. Spend 80% of your creative energy on them.

                    YOUTUBE SHORT SCRIPT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Title/Topic:
Target Duration: 34 seconds
Date:
Version:

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[HOOK] — 1 to 3 seconds
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Write this FIRST. The hook must pass the 1-Second Rule: within
  one second of hearing/reading this line, the viewer decides to
  stay or scroll. It must be instantly intriguing.

  Hook type (pick one):
    [ ] Bold claim     — "[Surprising statement that defies expectation]"
    [ ] Question       — "What happens when [vivid scenario]?"
    [ ] Challenge      — "I bet you can't [specific challenge]"
    [ ] Shock value    — "[Unexpected fact or number]"
    [ ] Direct address — "You've been doing [common thing] wrong"

  → HOOK LINE:



───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[SETUP] — 5 to 8 seconds
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Set the context. What is this about? What does the viewer need
  to know before the twist/payoff? Keep it tight — every word
  must earn its place. No throat-clearing, no "so basically..."

  → SETUP:



───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[BUT/THEN] — 15 to 20 seconds
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  This is the meat. Use a "But/Then" structure to create contrast,
  surprise, or escalation:

    Setup leads to expectation → BUT the opposite happens
    Setup establishes baseline → THEN something unexpected shifts it

  This section delivers the actual value, story, or punchline.
  Keep sentences short. Vary rhythm. Use pauses for emphasis.

  → BUT/THEN:



───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[LAST LINE] — 3 to 5 seconds
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Write this SECOND (immediately after the hook). The last line
  must create one or both of:

    1. SATISFACTION — The viewer feels the loop was closed
    2. REWATCH DESIRE — The viewer wants to see it again because:
       - They want to catch something they missed
       - The ending recontextualizes the beginning
       - The payoff was so good they want to relive it

  Last line type (pick one):
    [ ] Callback       — Echoes or inverts the hook line
    [ ] Punchline      — Unexpected humor or irony
    [ ] Reveal         — The answer to the hook's question
    [ ] Cliffhanger    — Opens a new curiosity loop (use sparingly)
    [ ] Emotional beat — Lands with weight and resonance

  → LAST LINE:



═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Quality Checks

Run every Short through this checklist before finalizing:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
QUALITY CHECKLIST
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Hook:
- [ ] Passes the 1-Second Rule (instantly grabs attention)?
- [ ] Contains no filler words (um, so, basically, hey guys)?
- [ ] Would make YOU stop scrolling?

Last Line:
- [ ] Creates satisfaction (loop closed)?
- [ ] Creates rewatch desire (want to see it again)?
- [ ] Connects back to the hook (bookend effect)?

Readability:
- [ ] 5th grade level or below?
- [ ] No jargon unless the audience expects it?
- [ ] Short sentences (under 15 words each)?

Pacing:
- [ ] Total length: approximately 34 seconds when read aloud?
- [ ] No section runs long (especially Setup — keep it tight)?
- [ ] Natural rhythm with varied sentence lengths?

Structure:
- [ ] But/Then structure is present and clear?
- [ ] The twist/contrast is genuinely surprising?
- [ ] Every sentence serves a purpose (no dead weight)?

Rewatch Trigger:
- [ ] At least one rewatch trigger is embedded?
- [ ] The Short rewards a second viewing?

## Common Rewatch Triggers

Use at least one of these in every Short:

| Trigger | How It Works | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Hidden detail** | A visual or verbal detail that only makes sense on rewatch | A word on screen that foreshadows the ending |
| **Speed reveal** | Information delivered quickly that viewers want to catch again | A list flashed on screen for 2 seconds |
| **Emotional punch** | A last line so impactful viewers want to feel it again | "And that was the last time he ever called." |
| **Callback loop** | The last line echoes or inverts the first line | Hook: "This costs $1." Last: "And that $1 is worth more than my car." |
| **Perspective shift** | The ending changes the meaning of the beginning | The "villain" turns out to be the narrator |

## Shorts vs. Long-Form: Key Differences

| Element | Long-Form | Shorts |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Hook window | 3-5 seconds | 1 second |
| Readability | 5th-8th grade | 5th grade max |
| Structure | Multi-act with re-hooks | Single arc (hook-setup-twist-land) |
| CTA | Mid + end | None (or very subtle) |
| Retention target | 40-50% | 90%+ |
| Rewatch importance | Low | Critical (algorithm signal) |
| Pacing | Varied | Consistently fast |

## Example: Completed Short

```
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
EXAMPLE: Finance Niche (~33 seconds)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[HOOK — 2 sec]
A dollar bill costs 1.2 cents to make.

[SETUP — 6 sec]
That means the government spends real money to print money. But
here's the thing most people don't realize...

[BUT/THEN — 20 sec]
A hundred dollar bill ALSO costs 1.2 cents to make. Same paper.
Same ink. Same press. The only difference is the number printed on
it. Which means the most expensive thing about money... isn't the
money. It's the story we all agreed to believe about what that
number means.

[LAST LINE — 5 sec]
So the next time someone says "money isn't real" — they're more
right than they know.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## Production Notes for Shorts

- **Captions are mandatory** -- 85% of Shorts are watched without sound
- **First frame matters** -- The thumbnail is the first frame; make it visually striking
- **Vertical only** -- 9:16 aspect ratio, no exceptions
- **No long intros** -- Start talking on frame 1
- **Music under, not over** -- Background music should complement, not compete with narration
- **Text overlays** -- Reinforce key words on screen, especially numbers and surprising facts
